<p>The UBC men’s hockey team will play their third and final playoff game against the University of Saskatchewan Huskies on Sunday evening. The best-of-three series is currently tied at one game apiece, as the Huskies stormed back from their 5-0 loss Friday night to take the Saturday game 5-2. </p>
<p>Despite holding a 1-3 record against Saskatchewan in the regular season, the Thunderbirds pulled off a decisive victory to set the tone in the first game of the series on Friday night. An entirely defensive first two periods finally gave way as Geordie Wudrick chipped in with the series’ first goal at 19:11 of the second period on a nifty feed from Cole Wilson. An assist later in the game would bring the red-hot scorer’s total to three points in his playoff debut with the Thunderbirds. The other goal scorers, all in the final frame, included Anthony Bardaro, Nate Fleming, and Nick Buonassisi. </p>
<p>Steven Stanford was perfect in his first career playoff start. He handled all 22 shots the Huskies threw at him and dominated Saskatchewan’s Ryan Holfeld in the goaltending battle. Though the two were seemingly unbeatable through the first two periods, the third proved to be the difference maker. Even though the Huskies only managed four shots in the frame, Stanford continued to look sharp and hold his ground. </p>
<p>The wall was broken, however, eight minutes into Saturday’s game, as Saskatchewan defenceman Kendall McFaull gave his team the early marker. The match didn’t look up from there. The home team added three more past Stanford, plus an empty-netter in the third. UBC answered with just two goals this time, coming again from Bardaro and Fleming. </p>
<p>After two games, UBC already has some hot offensive players. Bardaro and Wudrick are tied for second in the playoff scoring race, while four of the top 10 on that list are T-Bird forwards. It’s early in the run, but hopefully a good sign of things to come, and definitely a positive note to take from the loss.</p>
<p>“[The Huskies] did all the little things right. They played a desperate game, they weren’t going to lost two straight at home.” said UBC head coach Milan Dragicevic Saturday night, giving due credit to Saskatchewan. He didn’t fault the Thunderbird goaltending, though, adding that, “Stanny played great.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, the ‘Birds need to get back to the same type of determined play that they showed on Friday night. The underdog team barely made it into the playoffs, having only scraped through because Regina lost nine of its last eleven games to give the teams the exact same record at the end of the year – the deciding factor came down to the goal differential between the teams. With the gift of Regina’s collapse allowing the T-Birds their playoff chance, the team would surely be crushed to see their run end so soon.</p>
<p>With Sunday’s game being the third in three nights on the road, the visiting team has to be tired, but Dragicevic isn’t cutting them any slack. He brought the plan immediately back down to tactics.</p>
<p>“We have to eliminate their odd-man rushes &#8211; they scored three goals off the rush. We need to do the little things right.”</p>
<p>Adding to the pressure the Thunderbirds are facing is the recent controversy of the team’s undecided varsity status – the men’s hockey team was <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-athletes-review-results239/" title="UBC athletes attempt to stay united after initial sports review results" target="_blank">not confirmed</a> as safe in the first round of the decision-making process in January. The fans pushed back with an explosive show of support on social media, though, as the hashtags #SaveUBCHockey and #SellOutTheDoug ran rampant Twitter and Facebook. The campaign attracted some big-name supporters &#8211; most notably, Canucks defenceman Kevin Bieksa.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/twitter-ubc-hockey-calgary632/" title="Twitter campaign boosts men’s hockey against top-ranked Calgary" target="_blank">social media support</a> translated into results in the real world, as the Doug Mitchell Stadium came alive with chanting, neon signs, and painted bellies for the last games of the season. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Thunderbirds are a long way from home. Dragicevic is confident his team can win, but only if they dig deep. “We need to show the same desperation we did on Friday.” </p>
<p>It won’t be easy, but if there’s anything this team is used to, it’s the odds stacked against them. </p>

<p>In the second game of a women’s hockey <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-rookie-scores-ot-winner-1st-playoff-game321/" title="UBC rookie scores overtime winner in first women’s hockey playoff game" target="_blank">playoff series</a> battle against Calgary, UBC killed the Dinos’ playoff hopes with a 4-3 victory to sweep the best-of-three quarterfinal match up.</p>
<p>“It was pure thunderbird fashion,” said UBC head coach Graham Thomas. “We wrapped it up in one adrenaline rush or something. I don’t know what it is but there’s a lot of character, will and drive that goes into this.”</p>
<p>With goals from Canada West leading scorer <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/rafter-powers-ubc-532/" title="Rafter powers UBC women’s hockey to victories with record-breaking performance" target="_blank">Tatiana Rafter</a>, Nikola Brown-John and Melissa Goodwin, the T-Birds were up 3-1 heading into the third period. But the Dinos wouldn’t go down without a fight, scoring a goal in the 10th minute to bring themselves within one.</p>
<p>The T-Birds seemed to be faltering towards the end of the third period, failing to capitalize on several moments in the game. The Dinos finally caught up on a powerplay in the 16th minute as Kelsie Lang fired a shot past UBC goalie Danielle Lemon to equalize the game.</p>
<p>But with 70 seconds left in the game, it was assistant captain Sarah Casorso who came to the rescue for UBC. She weaved her way up the rink and literally shoved the puck – and herself – into the net for her second goal of the playoffs and the game-winner.</p>
<p>“The game winning goal from Sarah was funny,” said Thomas, who admitted he wasn’t on the best of terms with Casorso at some points during the game. “She was making some mistakes and fell during the game and missed one goal, so I was kind of stuck with her. We have a good relationship, so I sat her down and said to her to stop fighting me, in a jokey way, and it was unbelievable her response and the character to really just roll with that. It was just an unbelievable play.”</p>
<p>Calgary threw in an extra skater in the last minute of play to try to catch up, but even with a 6-on-4 powerplay the T-Birds were still able to held them off. In fact, the UBC penalty kill was solid all night, allowing just one goal on eight opportunities. Goalie Danielle Lemon got her first career playoff victory, stopping 17 of 20 shots.</p>
<p>“It’s great that everyone’s stepping it up a notch and elevating their game even higher,” said Thomas. “Some of those girls who aren’t on the scoresheet made things happen and helped change the momentum, and helped us get back on track. They’re so valuable to us.”</p>
<p>However, Thomas said the physicality of the game could have been costly for UBC as several players went down with injuries. Some were lucky enough to come back into the game, but one had to go to the hospital. “We were down four or five D, so it was a kind of gutsy, tough playoff – a hockey kind of win,” said Thomas.</p>
<p>With the series sweep, the ‘Birds will take a trip to Saskatoon next weekend for a rematch against the Saskatchewan Huskies in the Canada West semifinal round. Saskatchewan got the best of UBC in the final regular season games just a week ago, and the two losses dropped UBC from first to third in the conference.</p>
<p>“It’s time for a little redemption.”</p>

<p>Having slipped from first to third in the Canada West standings last weekend, the UBC women&#8217;s hockey team was eager to make a statement in their opening playoff game against the Calgary Dinos.</p>
<p>With the game forced to overtime, the T-Birds converged on the Dinos. UBC goalie Danielle Dube made a great save as she caught what looked like the game-deciding puck. Seizing the momentum at the other end of the ice, UBC rookie Melissa Goodwin became the hero for the home team. She made no mistake as she jumped on a loose puck in front of the Dino net, sealing a 3-2 win.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a rookie score the overtime winner was really something,&#8221; said UBC head coach Graham Thomas. &#8220;We had [said] before that we needed everyone to step up and we can’t just have the same people in the offense, so we needed some help from the younger ones. I think that’s the strength of our group – we’ve got depth so we can play and roll all the lines and have success.&#8221;</p>
<p>The game began with a fruitless first period, and then the Dinos drew first blood as Jessyka Holt shoved the puck into the back of the net in the 11th minute of the second frame.</p>
<p>UBC equalized in the 16th minute on a 4-on-3 powerplay, where T-Bird Nicole Saxvik slotted the puck past Dino goalie Amanda Tapp. </p>
<p>Five minutes into the third period, the Dinos pulled ahead again when Erika Mitschke fired the puck past Dube. But UBC quickly evened out again on another powerplay as Tapp fell forward and assistant captain Sarah Casorso flicked the puck into the net.</p>
<p>In the end, shots were 36-26 for UBC. Special teams were a big factor on the night, as the T-Birds went 2-for-5 on the powerplay but killed all three of their penalties.</p>
<p>With the win, UBC takes a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three series. The two teams will do battle at Thunderbird Arena again on Saturday night at 7 p.m. Sunday&#8217;s game is scheduled for 3 p.m. if necessary.</p>
<p>“We need to give [Calgary] a lot of credit,” said Thomas. “They came out and played hard, so tomorrow we have to make sure that we’re matching that. We’re desperate and hungry, and we need to make sure we realize that, and them, and make sure that we don’t take them lightly for one minute.”</p>
<p>UBC still has a target on their back after upsetting Calgary in last year’s playoffs and Thomas is well aware of that. “It was a good season,” he said. “But playoffs is basically a whole new season and we know that they’re going to come at us hard and they have an opportunity to get back at us.”</p>

<p>The AMS has announced that Block Party will be on Matthews Field this year. The field is located on south campus next to Thunderbird Stadium.</p>
<p>The concert has traditionally been held on MacInnes Field, but the AMS had to find a new location this year due to plans for construction of a <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/theblog/2014/02/05/new-ubc-aquatic-centre-387/" target="_blank">new aquatic centre</a>.</p>
<p>AMS events manager Anna Hillar said the new venue will still have a 6,500-person capacity and remain a 19+ event.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the best fields for us to have the event on. There&#8217;s not a lot of fences that are restricting us,&#8221; said Hillar.&#8221;I&#8217;m excited about the move. There&#8217;s obviously lots of logistics that are going to have to change &#8230; [but] because it&#8217;s a bigger field, everything&#8217;s going to be a bit bigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>The party runs from 2:45 p.m. to 9:15 p.m. on April 8, and tickets will be between $15 and $25. The AMS has yet to finalize the lineup for this year&#8217;s event. Hillar hopes to announce the lineup within the next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be a fantastic concert and the lineup is going to be awesome. I wish I could tell you it right now,&#8221; said Hillar.</p>

<p>After the referendum question giving the AMS permission to sell the expensive Whistler Lodge won by a 4.6 per cent margin in the January elections, some students want another vote.</p>
<p>The Ski and Board Club has launched a petition calling for a revote. However, the lodge lost the AMS $220,000 between 2005 and 2013, and the club has no specific financial plan for how to fix this.</p>
<p>Logan Parker, spokesperson for the Ski and Board Club, believes the lodge&#8217;s cultural and recreational benefits make the lodge worth keeping despite the money that is lost on it every year.</p>
<p>“We think [having a lodge] is a really neat opportunity for students to have at UBC and we see it in a different light too because while it is losing money right now, we feel that the Whistler Lodge shouldn’t be sold to solve short-term problems,” said Parker.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, the lodge is a large drain on AMS resources. The majority of UBC students do not use it when they go to Whistler and the house itself is in a state of severe disrepair. AMS President Caroline Wong pointed out that even the most basic renovations would cost upwards of $200,000 — money she feels could be better spent on other student services.</p>
<p>“In terms of capital spaces, we were looking at almost $2–300,000 in renovations right away,” said Wong. “And even if we advertised that and took a look at our operational losses as well, we would still lose about $55,000 a year.” </p>
<p>The money from the sale of the lodge would go into the AMS&#8217;s endowment fund. Wong suggested that the yearly proceeds from this money be used to subsidize skiers and snowboarders.</p>
<p>Parker argues that with new management, better advertisement, and some repairs, the lodge could once again be made both into a profitable student business and a longstanding symbol of skiing culture on campus.</p>
<p>“We want to work with [the AMS] as much as possible because we agree with them that the lodge isn’t making money right now and that it isn’t sustainable and that things do need to change,” said Parker. “We just see the change not as selling the lodge, but rather as taking that as more incentive to make it profitable.” </p>
<p>Wong said that there are other, much more sustainable, symbols of student culture that will continue to be built for UBC students in the years to come.</p>
<p>“We’re going to continue building these kinds of legacies,” said Wong. “Keeping [the lodge] for the sake of a symbol and losing money where we could be using it for other services and events for students doesn’t really make sense to me.”</p>
<p>The petition would need to gather 1,000 student signatures to allow the Ski and Board Club to call a second referendum.</p>

<p>RCMP were called to escort a homeless man out of the Irving K. Barber library at 10:15 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Brian Brasnett of the university RCMP said the man was causing a disturbance in the area, leading the staff inside the building to make a complaint to Campus Security. </p>
<p>Campus Security then notified the university RCMP detachment of the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;In any of these situations where we feel that the RCMP need to be aware, we contact them. It&#8217;s a standard procedure,&#8221; said Barry Eccleton, director of Campus Security. </p>
<p>&#8220;We just talked to him and explained the situation, and he said he was going to move along,&#8221; said Brasnett.</p>
<p>Brasnett said this was not the same individual who was escorted out of Koerner <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/homeless-man-koerner-123/">earlier this year</a>, and that this is a common occurrence in the UBC area.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do get a lot of homeless persons visiting the UBC area, looking for shelter in the cold and that&#8217;s probably part of it, somewhere to stay, somewhere to warm up,&#8221; he said. </p>

<p>The god of average conceptual art is a used condom. Made a symbol of time, consumer society or what have you, rubbers seem to be a cornerstone of contemporary art in its most common acceptation, shocking old ladies and celebrating a youth that is both conquering and degenerate.</p>
<p>Of the thousand messages this plastic beauty can embody, Emma Windsor-Liscombe chose to denounce the sterility of politics, of all things. The condom is here pinned and framed, underlined by a series of old-fashioned print letters spelling “nothing changes” over and over. It is called &#8220;Conceptual Politics 1 (The Usual Mindset)&#8221; and is one of the dozen works of art that are currently exposed at the AMS Art Gallery in the SUB. The exhibit is entitled “Re-Believing in a Post-Apocalyptic World.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exhibition, in the words of the artist, “combines reflective-traditionalist portraiture-essay to bring back elegance in portrait painting, conceptual drawing and conceptual found-object sculpture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which leads us to wonder where the artist accidentally “found” semen. Because yes, there is obviously semen, or at least Windsor-Liscombe states there is in one of her brown paper bags (what she calls “modern reliquaries”), alongside a pillbox, or a dried flower.</p>
<p>Overall, the exhibition gives an impression of a very conservative conceptual art exhibit — one that does not state anything but merely repeats what others have said of modernity, featuring items that could be part of a “bingo&#8221; of conceptual art essentials. The artist even displays her studies, a process we could allow under the shield of the symbolically unfinished, but this is most commonly accepted when in an exhibition of a true master. As it is, most of the works convey an art student&#8217;s project; not a particularly bad one, but not a good one, either.</p>
<p>Two observations can tame this criticism. Firstly, the closed paper bags make you curious. I admit that I bent to try and see through the vagina-shaped hole in order to discern whether there was indeed semen in the paper bag entitled &#8220;reliquary 7.&#8221; Or was it vagina-shaped? After all, it was just an oblong oval. This question arose from my curiosity; other observers may see many things.</p>
<p>The second success is a plastic one. The &#8220;Modern Virgin&#8221; (chalk and pastel on brown paper) is a quality piece of art, both peaceful and contemporary. It is definitely worth a look; but the rest of the exhibition is most likely to be appreciated by dedicated conceptual art-lovers or polite art enthusiasts.</p>
<p><em>Re-Believing in a Post-Apocalyptic World is on display at the SUB art gallery until Feb. 14.</em></p>

<p><font face="sans-serif">One big anxiety we missed in our survey options was &#8220;body image,&#8221; and many respondents let us know in the comments. There were a variety of other responses, including &#8220;That they&#8217;ll treat me like a female object instead of a human, i.e. not respond to my body but to their preconceptions of female bodies&#8221; and &#8220;potentially awkward day after.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">Pregnancy was a bigger concern for women and than men, which brings us to the pregnancy questions. <strong>4% of women said they had inadvertently become pregnant</strong> and another <strong>39% thought they had</strong>. That compares to <strong>5% of men who reported inadvertently getting a woman pregnant</strong> and <strong>20% who thought they had.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">One the question of <strong>whether they would seek to terminate an inadvertent pregnancy, 59% of women said yes while 10% said no</strong> and the rest were unsure.</font></p>

<h2 class="fw_section_break fw_center clear">Relationships</h2>
<p><font face="sans-serif"><em><strong>Sex doesn&#8217;t need to involve relationships, and even romantic relationships don&#8217;t need to involve sex. But both often do, and so we asked you your thoughts on love, dating and, well, relationships</strong>.</em></font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif"><strong>14% of respondents said they have never been in a relationship</strong>, while a narrow plurality of 25% have been in just one &#8220;exclusive/monogamous or otherwise committed relationship.&#8221; 24% have been in two, 19% in three and 11% in four, with the remainder having been in five or more.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">Asked if they would cheat on their partner if there was no chance he or she would find out, 13% said yes including 6% of people who said they had never cheated on a partner in the past. 17% of respondents who said they <em>had</em> cheated on a partner before, said they wouldn&#8217;t do it again even if they had a chance, which suggests the old adage, <strong>&#8220;once a cheater, always a cheater,&#8221; may not be entirely accurate.</strong></font></p>
<div class="fw_right"><a href="http://ubyssey.ca/features/screen-shot-2014-02-13-at-4-29-51-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-43555"><img src="http://ubyssey.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-13-at-4.29.51-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-13 at 4.29.51 PM" width="692" height="467" class="alignright size-full wp-image-43555" /></a></div>
<p><font face="sans-serif">When it came to breakups, <strong>30% said they had been dumped by email, IM or text</strong> and 26% said the person ended up by simply cutting off contact (22% have had their partner&#8217;s end things over the phone and 7% over video chat).</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">Others had more creative exes.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">Some fit into the provided categories, but wanted to clarify exactly what happened.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">&#8220;Written on my cup of Starbucks coffee, obscured by the sleeve,&#8221; one person explained in the comments.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">&#8220;Technically over the phone, seeing as he told me he cheated on me via phone, therefore I ended the relationship.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">Only <strong>27% thought breakups should &#8220;always&#8221; take place face to face</strong>, while 58% thought in person was best &#8220;if it is reasonable to do so.&#8221; <strong>Just 2% thought breaking up electronically or over the phone was as a good as in person.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">When it comes to the three big words, <strong>57% said they would never tell a partner they loved them unless it was true</strong>. 31% said they had done it in the past to avoid hurting their partner&#8217;s feelings (14%), to make them happy (15%) or to convince their partner to have sex (2%). Another 11% said that while they had never done it before, they might lie about love in the future.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">57% of respondents said they felt pressure to get married and <strong>76% said it was at least &#8220;somewhat&#8221; important for a boyfriend or girlfriend to have marriage potential</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">While <strong>72% said they would not break up with a significant other if he or she gained weight</strong>, 37% of men said they would compared only 19% of women.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">Respondents listed &#8220;a sense of caring/nurturing&#8221; as the most important trait in deciding whether a partner was &#8220;relationship material.&#8221; That option beat out &#8220;a sense of loyalty&#8221; (24%), &#8220;a sense of humor&#8221; (20%) and intelligence (18%).</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">People agreed by a wide margin that the bill on dates should be split; <strong>only 27% said the man should pay</strong>. In the comments section, many respondents said they thought the man should pay on the first few dates and then it should be alternated or that whoever initiated the date should pay.</font></p>
<p><font face="sans-serif">27% said they had lied to someone they were sleeping with about how many sexual partners they&#8217;ve had.</font></p>

<p><font face="sans-serif">The comments on the professor sex one were a quite interesting.

<p><em><strong>POLLING DATA:</strong> This survey was conducted online over 12 days. It was an opt-in survey publicized through The Ubyssey’s social media and does not represent a scientifically valid sample of UBC’s student population. However, respondents constituted a mostly accurate balance of men and women and students from different faculties when compared to UBC’s enrolment totals. 1,128 individuals completed the survey and these results are based on their answers.</em></p>

<p>It has been nearly two years since Vancouver indie rock outfit Lakefield has rehearsed or played a live show, and on Friday, Feb. 14, the release of their final EP <em>Swan Songs</em> marked their official disbandment. </p>
<p>“At the beginning of 2012, the band stopped playing. But at that time we promised, &#8216;OK, we have all these songs that are yet unrecorded and if we don’t do it now they’re just going to fade away into the ether,&#8217;” said Lakefield’s Steven Luscher, a former UBC student who studied math. </p>
<p>Lakefield’s six-song EP was recorded with the band’s end in mind.  </p>
<p>“We’re not going to cover it up, or try and skirt around the issue that this is the last release. We’re just going to put it out front and centre and say this is the last release — we’re going to call it <em>Swan Songs</em> because that’s what it is,&#8221; said Luscher.</p>
<p>Lakefield&#8217;s <a href="http://lakefieldmusic.com">website</a> explains the significance of the album&#8217;s title with the following: “Legend has it that the mute swan lives its entire life in silence, until delivering one beautiful performance in the moment before its death. The <em>Swan Songs</em> EP is Lakefield’s.”</p>
<p>After their five-year run, Lakefield has decided to call this the end. While their reasons for ending are rather ambiguous, Luscher says they’re mainly just occupied with things other than music. </p>
<p>The band formed in 2008, comprising three friends from Ontario and two Vancouver natives, who all became acquainted while living in Vancouver. Guitarist Steven Lusher and drummer Paul Teehan both attended UBC. Luscher completed the prerequisites for a math minor and attempted to get his bachelor of education, but dropped out after one term; Teehan is currently a PhD student at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. Two years after meeting, the band released their debut album, <em>Songs From the Treeline</em>. </p>
<p><em>Songs From the Treeline</em> delivers a consistent track-by-track hour of singer-songwriter piano pop fused with emo post-rock, all masked by vocal driven male-female harmonizations. While it isn’t their intent, hopefully Lakefield will be able to top themselves with their final album release, allowing them to end on a high note.</p>
<p>“This is the end,&#8221; said Luscher. &#8220;We made one last effort all the way to the end. We didn’t give up and drop it.”</p>
