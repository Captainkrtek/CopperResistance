<p>The UBC Bookstore opening <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/ubc-bookstore-delayed-343/" target="_blank">has been delayed</a>, which one supposes was inevitable given that manager Debbie Harvey called the projected opening date “delusional.”</p>
<p>What doesn’t make sense though, actually, is to refer to the delayed opening being at “the bookstore.” Because, of course, UBC had a perfectly functional bookstore. Was anyone avoiding purchasing textbooks because the store wasn’t at street level? Because its windows weren’t big enough? No way.</p>
<p>But this renovation isn’t about books — it is about turning the bookstore into “<a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/ubc-bookstore-re-branding-efforts-met-with-petition-887/" target="_blank">UBC Central</a>.” Harvey and friends tried to make the push for this change, renaming the bookstore with a more generic name, a couple years ago, and the university said no — as they should have. But the bookstore hasn’t given up its dream of becoming more than a bookstore. Indeed, it wants to become UBC’s prime emporium for all things university. Which is, of course, absurd. </p>
<p>The campus bookstore should be a place to buy textbooks at the beginning of the term, and books and magazines at other times during the year. It should also sell office supplies — binders, notebooks, the kind of things you need for school — and UBC apparel and souvenirs. Beyond that, the store’s expansion into selling more clothing, odd toys, more food and opening a new café seem altogether unnecessary. There are better places to get everything the bookstore sells, and its location on campus only makes it convenient when it comes to selling things people want for school and can’t get elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p>Sorry, guys, we already have enough <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/videos/ubc-coffee923/" target="_blank">Starbucks</a>.  </p>
<h3 class="subhead">Budget shortfalls concerning</h3>
<p>UBC student services are currently underfunded by $2.6 million.</p>
<p>$2 million of this shortage is in Work Learn and Go Global, but what is more concerning is the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/lack-of-funding-for-ubc-counselling456/" target="_blank">shortfall in disability advising and Student Health Services</a>.</p>
<p>Even though director of Student Health Services Patricia Mirwaldt says UBC&#8217;s services are actually more accessible than in many clinics across the Lower Mainland, 965 students were turned away from Student Health Services during the second term last year. And UBC needs $100,000 more for another full-time employee in disability advising to fund the increase in cases from 1,500 to 1,800. </p>
<p>UBC&#8217;s plan commits them to increasing support for student well-being, and they do acknowledge that the services they currently offer are inadequate. UBC needs to find the funding to be able to operate these services at a satisfactory level. </p>
<p>And when they do get the funding, hopefully they have their priorities straight. While international programs like Go Global scream prestige — and don&#8217;t get us wrong, getting more students going on exchanges is a nice idea — it is more important to ensure the health and well-being, both physical and mental, of the thousands of students who are already here. </p>
<h3 class="subhead">Strides made on mental health</h3>
<p>Five years ago at UBC, we didn’t really talk about depression on campus. Early Alert was not a part of RA or student leader training and UBC counselling was swamped with students. You can poke through the <em>Ubyssey</em> archives yourself, but a quick search of “depression” shows up mostly in opinion pieces and articles about research. </p>
<p>That’s a stark contrast to the conversation we’re having today. Mental health is at the forefront how the university interacts with students. Now, you have to skim through several pages of articles about mental health initiatives and websites relating to depression in recent years if you Google “depression UBC.” And while students might not be able to get access to a doctor, UBC says they at least see 100 per cent of people who show up at counselling. </p>
<p>And it’s not just the university — it’s our society in general. Bell’s “Let’s Talk” campaign, aimed at breaking the stigma around depression and other mental health issues, was a booming success this year, raising almost $5.5 million. You can find conversations about depression and mental health in news, arts and sports blogs, all of which play a part in destigmatizing mental health, one of the most important parts of winning this battle.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Time for new VFM rules</h3>
<p>This year’s voter-funded media crop was a joke — and only partly on purpose.</p>
<p>While two blogs produced actual, elections-focused content, three blogs did essentially nothing. Tyler Suzuki-Nelson, a perennial blogger, wrote one post about how voter-funded media is dumb and a bunch of things about his life. TRU-Watch, a Chinese blog, was a great idea, but the editor only published two articles: one on diversity and explaining the value their blog would bring, and another with the names of all the candidates. Then they stopped. Vote for Me, UBC was the epitome of the broken VFM system — they published one post about how they just wanted money.</p>
<p>We think voter-funded media is a great thing. It gives us some competition, and spices up the elections as blogs will typically cover the elections in a way that we don’t. <a href="http://ubcinsiders.ca" target="_blank">UBC Insiders</a>, a blog that ran between 2007 and 2013, actually did interesting investigative journalism that brought up important issues on campus. </p>
<p>We think VFM should be better funded, but there should also be stricter rules. There should be minimum content guidelines if a blog is to receive funding. Seven posts that are at least 200 words, for example, and that relate to the election or campus politics. With proper controls, VFM can help improve the conversation around the election and potentially around campus. But that depends on new election rules, something AMS Council has a hard time remembering to fix until it’s too late.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Mining institute needs close supervision</h3>
<p>UBC’s <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/ubc-mining-institute-324/" target="_blank">new mining institute</a> has the potential to do good. Its goal, according to a professor who is part of the institute, is to alleviate poverty.</p>
<p>But its close association with the federal government and the implicit goal to receive industry funding is cause for concern. The federal government’s control over its scientists is well documented and impedes academic freedom, damaging the integrity of supposedly impartial voice. For the institute, government funding and the expressed desire to seek future funding from industry may muzzle a group that should be advocating for miners and the rights of people affected by mining operations around the world.</p>
<p>At the very least, it’s something that needs watching. While not the outright evil that some activists claim it to be, the institute could become little more than an industry mouthpiece without proper safeguards.</p>

<p>The Arts Undergraduate Society&#8217;s old mascot, Barney, has stepped down to make way for the AUS Owl. </p>
<p>After a voting period of five days in November, the newly chosen mascot, which will represent 12,000 Faculty of Arts students, was revealed on Jan. 13, the first day of Arts Week.</p>
<p>AUS VP internal and AMS VP admin elect Ava Nasiri said the search for the new mascot began last year because the Barney suit was worn out and the AUS was running a budget surplus. </p>
<p>Barney was originally acquired by the AUS in 2007 after being adopted from a Dumpster by the McDonald&#8217;s on campus. </p>
<p>“Given the students&#8217; attachment to wearing the Barney suit, it was an organic choice to make it the mascot,” said Nasiri. “Since at this point the physical Barney suit has deteriorated severely &#8230; it was time to make a change.”</p>
<p>AUS clubs and associations have been showing their support for the new mascot. “I personally feel that the mascot change from Barney to the owl is awesome,” said Alex Bouchard, president of the French club. “I think this AUS rebranding is for the best.”</p>
<p>“Arts has been struggling for a few years [trying] to figure out a sense of identity,&#8221; said German club president Jonathan Elmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is good to have a symbol of reference for members of any organization &#8230; so as to better organize and unite students,” said Avi Ames, the AUS representative for the Sociology Students Association.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Islam Awareness Week was a profound experience. Thanks to the Muslim Students Association for an engaging event. The speaker on Monday was well read, engaging and entertaining. I am not religious and wanted a better understanding of Islam for general context. I was expecting to watch a PowerPoint presentation and to feel slightly awkward. My actual experience was far better. </p>
<p>The speaker was well experienced in discussing Islam with Western audiences; he had hosted BBC panels on Islam and lectured at multiple Western universities. I certainly did not expect examples from World War II to the Byzantine Empire to be used to deconstruct the militant stereotypes of Islam. I also did not expect a discussion we had on political philosophy; he contrasted the ideas of Jeremy Bentham on utilitarianism with Islam, and we discussed Aldous Huxley’s soma. That evening was the image of university as a horizon-broadening institution brought to life.             </p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>As a UBC alumnus (&#8217;97) and a former member of the Thunderbird men’s volleyball team, I have spent the last 14 years coaching at NCAA schools (13 of those in Division I), and I have read your recent articles about UBC’s decision to restructure the funding within their athletic programs with great interest — and no small amount of dismay. Prioritizing sports funding in order to achieve specific goals that benefit the university is a legitimate aim, but UBC must have the courage to be honest and public that this is what they are trying to achieve and that their sports will be selected to achieve this goal. In both of these areas, they have failed, and in doing so have wasted a golden opportunity to turn their athletic department into a sports juggernaut that dramatically increases the profile and desirability of the school.   </p>
<p>To achieve the maximum positive exposure for the school, all athletic teams should be funded and tasked with winning at the national level while creating an exciting, dynamic on-campus environment. Since UBC cannot afford to do this for all of its current teams, the selection process should determine which sports i) are the most relevant to the school’s target audience (winning national championships in checkers isn’t relevant to many people), ii) can provide the best game-day environment for current students, the local community and TV audiences, and iii) have the best chance at national success. Schools in NCAA Division I are the most obvious examples of this, and they reap huge benefits by creating the perception that the school is a fun, exciting, cool place to go. UBC could set this curve for Canada. It would be a daring, exciting, visionary project. Sadly, their current path uses an opaque selection process to achieve inarticulate goals.</p>
<p>If UBC wants to transform its athletic department into a PR machine to increase the school’s profile (à la Stanford, Notre Dame, Duke, etc.), then more power to them. However, the complete lack of clarity in stating their goals or transparency in selecting the teams will not achieve this. How can a world-class academic institution with a reputation for excellence and integrity follow a process lacking both? UBC is the Canadian school best situated to create a relevant sports dynasty and I applaud the attempt. But they should at least have the courage to be honest that this is what they are doing. </p>

<p>The UBC women&#8217;s hockey team won their 20th game this season on Saturday afternoon in a 4-1 victory over the Mount Royal University Cougars.</p>
<p>UBC jumped to an early 1-0 lead as Hannah Heisler put in a wraparound off of a pass from Emily O’Neill. </p>
<p>In the second period, the &#8216;Birds added two more around the halfway point. After a pass from Stefanie Schaupmeyer, a wide shot from Nikola Brown-John made its way to the back of the net in the 11th minute of play. This was followed by Nicole Saxvik&#8217;s 10th goal of the season about a minute later, a side shot that sent the puck into the corner of the net.</p>
<p>The Cougars wouldn&#8217;t get one back until the 11th minute of the third period, but by then, it was too little too late. With the &#8216;Birds up 3-1, Brown-John scored an empty-netter in the last minute of play.</p>
<p>UBC goalie Danielle Lemon looked strong in her fifth victory of the season, stopping 25 of the 26 shots fired at her. Her Cougar counterpart, Jess Ross, stopped 26 of 30.</p>
<p>UBC head coach Graham Thomas was happy with the result, though he said he will be sad to see the seniors go.</p>
<p>“We tied our identity with each one,” Thomas said. “With Halvorson and her dedication, and she’s been really resilient with her career; Capozzi, with her heart, [is] relentless, and she just shows this every single time she’s on the ice; and then there’s Burgess, who shows character [and] earns respect from everyone and her teammates,” said Thomas.</p>
<p>With the weekend sweep, UBC moved their record to 20-5-1, the best in Canada West. Mount Royal were unable to clinch a spot in playoffs with a record of 7-16-3. UBC went 13-0-1 at Thunderbird Arena this season, and would benefit from home ice advantage come playoff time. To ensure this, they&#8217;ll need to stay ahead of Alberta and Saskatchewan, who are still within striking distance. UBC will have plenty of control over their fate as they fly to Saskatchewan for the last two regular season games. The playoffs are set to begin on Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>For three graduating Thunderbirds, Saturday was their last regular season home game. Kelsey Halvorson received a golden helmet for her 100th game as a Thunderbird — just in time, as she graduates with Nadine Burgess and captain Christi Capozzi. All three were honoured prior to puck drop. </p>
<p>Capozzi was emotional as she reflected on her season and her time being a Thunderbird. “It’s been an unbelievable season. We’re suddenly more active, making more efforts and making history for our program,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="http://ubyssey.ca/featured-slide/ubcs-capozzi-rafter-set-hit-ice-2013-winter-universiade/" title="UBC’s Capozzi and Rafter set to hit the ice at 2013 Winter Universiade" target="_blank">Capozzi also spoke of her time in Trentino</a> for the World University Games with Team Canada. “It was an incredible opportunity to put on a maple leaf and it’s every young hockey player’s dream, so I’m super thankful for that.” </p>
<p>As for the departing senior’s future plans, Capozzi admits she’s keeping her options open.</p>
<p>“[I might do] some beer league!” she joked. “There are no solid plans right now, but I think I’ll focus some of this energy on my career and see where that can get me.”</p>

<p>As students and generally busy people, pasta is a staple in our diets. When eaten in moderation and balanced with other nutritious foods, pasta is definitely a good choice for its slow-release energy and the general &#8220;comfort food&#8221; quality it exudes.</p>
<p>This is a quick, easy, better-than-Kraft version of macaroni and cheese. It uses real cheese, and therefore has real flavour; it&#8217;s also probably slightly better for you than your average package of neon orange pasta. Plus, it takes only 13 minutes to prepare.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Upgraded Mac and Cheese</h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>Water<br />
2 cups dried macaroni pasta (other types can be substituted, but this is a classic)<br />
4 ounces of cream cheese<br />
1 teaspoon of garlic powder<br />
Black pepper<br />
Pinch of cayenne pepper<br />
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese<br />
3 tablespoons fresh or dried breadcrumbs</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>
<p>Medium-sized bowl<br />
Pot</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling water until soft enough to eat. This should take around six to eight minutes. Reserve one cup of the boiling liquid, then drain the pasta. Do not rinse.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, add the cream cheese, black pepper and cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>Pour the cooked pasta onto the cream cheese mixture, and allow the hot pasta to stand on top of the cream cheese until melted. This will take around a minute.</li>
<li>Stir the pasta to distribute the cream cheese and spices evenly. Add the remaining water slowly, tablespoon by tablespoon until the sauce reaches a creamy, smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Add the breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan, and serve immediately.</li>
<li>Optional, but recommended: pour the macaroni and cheese into a small baking dish, then top with the Parmesan and breadcrumbs and place in an oven at 350 degrees for around three minutes, or until the crumbs become golden brown.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: makes four servings. For the gourmands among you, adding other ingredients is an excellent way to turn this into an even greater meal. Green onions, diced chicken breast or bacon are good places to start.</em></p>

<p>A UBC-based mining institute officially launched Wednesday at a ceremony in downtown Vancouver. While university officials have touted its potential to help the developing world, critics are questioning its independence from industry and government.</p>
<p>The institute, based on campus at the Technology Enterprise Facility, is a partnership between UBC, SFU and École Polytechnique de Montréal. It is funded by a five-year $25 million grant from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).</p>
<p>Known as the Canadian International Institute for Extractive Industries and Development (CIIEID), the stated goal of the institute is to help developing countries draft regulations and policies governing natural resource extraction.</p>
<p>“UBC has a strong track record in the field of sustainable, socially responsible mining and we are delighted to join hands with our colleagues at Simon Fraser University and École Polytechnique de Montréal to effect lasting change,” John Hepburn, UBC VP research and international, said in a <a href="http://news.ubc.ca/2014/01/29/international-sustainable-mining/">UBC press release</a>.</p>
<p>The institute will work with governments of developing countries in order to alleviate poverty in those regions, said Malcolm Scoble, director of advisory services as CIIEID and former head of UBC’s mining engineering department.</p>
<p>“A major emphasis is the need to ensure that there’s economic well-being and health and safety and poverty alleviation as a consequence,” Scoble said. </p>
<p>CIIEID will conduct research on foreign government’s policies toward the mining industry, coordinate dialogue between local populations in affected areas and governments or mining companies and assist vulnerable groups, identified as women and aboriginal peoples, to benefit from mining operations in their countries.</p>
<p>The funding from CIDA will allow the institute to operate for five years, and UBC and SFU have committed to running the institute for at least five years. While UBC has already contributed $6.69 million to CIIEID, it is not clear who will fund the institute in the future.</p>
<p>A UBC report pointed to three potential sources of funding: donations from mining, oil and gas companies, donations and grants from other sources, and tuition or fees for CIIEID-provided services. Among the CIIEID&#8217;s 60 &#8220;institutional partners&#8221; are several mining corporations, including Vancouver-based Goldcorp.</p>
<p>Critics of the institute say its funding from the federal government compromises its independence and that it may seek to aid industry over the interests of local populations in the areas it works. A group of UBC and SFU students have organized under the name “Not From My Campus” to raise awareness about what they see as potential issues with the institute.</p>
<p>The group met with UBC President Stephen Toope to express its concerns, and he responded to the group in a letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to affirm that the CIIEID was created to generate new knowledge through research, to share that knowledge through education and training and to provide technical assistance,&#8221; Toope wrote. &#8220;It is an independent academic centre and is not an instrument of the government of Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jennifer Moore of the Canadian-based NGO Mining Watch believes the institute will in fact promote Canadian trade interests.</p>
<p>“We see this &#8230; very much as part of trying to promote the interests of Canadian mining companies overseas,” said Moore.</p>
<div class="ub_quote"><span class="double-quote">&#8220;</span><p>We see this very much as part of trying to promote the interests of Canadian mining companies overseas.&#8221;</p><p class="author">&#8212;&nbsp; Jennifer Moore, Mining Watch</p></div>
<p>Moore also questioned the institute’s independence from Ottawa.</p>
<p>“The government has ensured that it has considerable influence over both what the institute can say publicly about its work and also in terms of the direction of the institute,” Moore said.</p>
<p>That CIDA is funding the institute has also provoked criticism.</p>
<p>Nipa Banerjee, a professor at the University of Ottawa specializing in international development, said that following CIDA’s integration with Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade over the summer, government development funds are now more focused on helping Canadian companies.</p>
<p>“The main critique I have is that it’s really not humanitarian assistance anymore,” said Banerjee, who worked for CIDA for 35 years. “It is directly linked with Canada’s economic interests.”</p>
<p>Documents show the university recognized that it might receive criticism over the institute.</p>
<p>“Work of institute perceived to primarily respond to Canadian industry needs vs. developing countries,” was listed under potential “reputational” risks to the university if it approved the CIIEID, according to an April 2013 report, written by Hepburn, given to UBC’s Board of Governors.</p>
<p>The university declined to make Hepburn available to answer questions about the institute.</p>
<p>CIIEID director Bern Klein was also unavailable to comment, as he was on institute business in South Africa, but Scoble defended CIIEID’s independence.</p>
<p>“We’re all quite confident that we can maintain this fully independent situation,” Scoble said, while admitting it might be difficult to do so at times.</p>
<p>Scoble said the institute is a wonderful opportunity for Canadian universities to contribute to the developing world and that it had the potential to be more effective than past efforts by CIDA and the Canadian government.</p>
<p>“We’ve got an inherent belief in the nature of this kind of assistance to the developing world and we want to try and make it succeed,” Scoble said.</p>
<p>Critics like Moore remain unswayed on the potential for the institute to do positive work.</p>
<p>“I think that there’s not a lot of potential given how it’s been conceived and established,” Moore said.</p>

<p>“Oh my God, this is a war!” </p>
<p>Shael Guyan of Team Dat Asterix can’t contain his excitement as he cheers on a teammate locked in a one-on-one jousting marathon in an inflatable ring.</p>
<p>Billed as a collection of “unconventional activities” that challenge the mind, body and team, UBC REC&#8217;s Gladiator event took over the second floor of the Student Rec Centre Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Forty teams signed up and gathered to rotate through five events facing off against one other team at each Under the Sea-themed station. Blue lights contributed to the dramatic atmosphere and pop hits spanning the last 20 years blared from speakers. </p>
<p>At “In Search of Atlantis: The Lost Empire,” contenders were required to find puzzle pieces in a maze and bring them outside to assemble a photo of Atlantis. The all-female Phly Phi team was made up of people who had “never heard of this before last week,” and people like fourth-year Arts student Katy Ogloff who was back for a second year.</p>
<p>“I liked that you don’t necessarily need to be athletic, even though I am,” she said. &#8220;[It’s] mentally challenging as well and you’re working as a team.”</p>
<p>Though her team lost the puzzle challenge, their opponents came over to exchange sportsmanlike “good game” handshakes.</p>
<p>For Ogloff, the name “Gladiator” was a successful marketing strategy.</p>
<p>“It makes people interested, definitely,” she said. “They’re like, ‘What is that?’&#8230;. It’s ambiguous enough that people want to know.”</p>
<p>But in reality, the competition was not what some participants expected when they thought of the name “Gladiator.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’s almost the opposite. You think of blood. Manliness,” said Ogloff’s teammate, fourth-year sociology major Andrea Mameri.</p>
<p>At the &#8220;Free Willy&#8221; station, players navigated an inflatable obstacle course of stairs and slides while holding an ocean-dwelling stuffed animal. While Beta Pi team member and second-year Arts student Hogan Chan waited to enter the course, he said the photos online attracted him to the event.</p>
<p>“I saw a giant Q-tip so I said, ‘I like giant Q-tips,’” Chan said with a laugh. He decided that the so-called “Q-tip” station was the most true to the Gladiator name.</p>
<p>“You got the weapon, you got the helmet, and you got the competing element,” he said. </p>
<p>As for those Q-tips, they presented arguably the most physically challenging task of the event. At the “duel for the Black Pearl,” players faced off in an inflatable ring and tried to knock their opponent off of a three-foot wide square platform using a foam baton that did indeed resemble a giant inflatable Q-tip. Though the most “gladiator-like” station deflated in the first round, it was soon pumped up again. Second-year history student Cheryl Nordal watched her Dat Asterix teammate face off and did not let her forget the gravity of the situation while beating her hands against the side of the ring.</p>
<p>“This is what you worked for your whole life!” she screamed to her teammate, who eventually won the round.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629808000346" target="_blank">Researchers</a> have called the film <em>Gladiator</em> “an investigation of the stoic code of the warrior, the applicability of morality in the face of violence and imminent death, and an investigation of resistance in the face of apparent defeat and impossible odds.”</p>
<p>So what does the term “gladiator” bring to mind for first-year engineering student Jarek Tan? </p>
<p>“Being a beast!” </p>
<p>“I think &#8216;intense warrior,&#8217;” said fourth-year genetics and psychology student Paria Assadipour as she stood at the &#8220;Escaping Ursula’s Lair&#8221; game. “There’s only one actual gladiator station, and the rest are just to keep it going.” </p>
<p>As she finished her sentence, her helmet-wearing teammate was nailed in the head with a tennis ball shot from a motorized machine. </p>
<p>“It gets a little physical, you could say,” she said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Assadipour’s team faced off against the Glawdiators who were — you guessed it — a team of law students. Aicha Kouyate, a third-year law student, was also expecting a tougher course.</p>
<p>“It’s a little more tame than I expected,” she said. “I was thinking, not blood, but more physical.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the least physical station was “Finding Nemo,” where competitors searched a dark fog-filled equipment room for tiny Nemos in bins. </p>
<p>Alena Freberg, a UBC REC staff member, was the director of the Gladiator event this year. Her crew took suggestions from friends and coworkers and chose the theme based on popularity, feasibility and decorating logistics. Past event themes have included Tron and recess; this year, they decided on ocean-themed events. Freberg said the new format was a welcome change. </p>
<p>“It’s nice this year also because it’s only time slot champions, so you’re only required to be here for two hours,” she said. “So it’s a good study break, especially with midterms coming up. It’s just a lot of fun.”</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Real-life Roman gladiators</h3>
<p>Though gladiators are portrayed in pop culture as rogue beasts, they were historically very different. Siobhán McElduff is a UBC professor who specializes in early Roman history and teaches <a href="http://seeingspectacles.com/" target="_blank">a second-year class</a> on Greek and Roman spectacles — including gladiators.</p>
<p>“In popular culture they are heroic individuals who don’t play by the rules,” she said. “You can send one guy in a theatre against 10 men and they use every weapon they can, and they’re mainly naked most of the time — at least according to the <em>Spartacus</em> TV series — and the death rate is incredibly high and it’s a miracle if our heroes survive beyond a year or two.”</p>
<p>In reality, McElduff said, scholars know the “particularly deadly sport” featured fighters with one set of weapons, a highly regimented atmosphere and a measly 10 per cent death rate. For 500 years starting around 300 BCE, McElduff said gladiators were highly paid fighters who had often trained at gladiator schools since childhood.</p>
<p>“All the Romans really [wanted was] skill,” she said. “I mean, they liked to see the occasional death, but nobody wants to see a whole pile of death.”</p>
<p>Today, McElduff said the Ultimate Fighting Championship and professional boxing would be the most comparable sports for their “stripped down” nature that crowns a clear victor. The main difference today, though, is the celebratory nature of one-on-one combat for entertainment. In ancient Rome, gladiators became <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=BmH31IK-OgEC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=infame+ancient+rome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ajZhtEsIPy&amp;sig=Cn3HAWXxVUChJwKhCbb-aUFUw68&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tmrtUsmkMtGFogShpYAo&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=infames&amp;f=false" target="_blank">infames</a> who lost most of their legal rights and were classified at the same level as those who sold their bodies, including actors and prostitutes.</p>
<div class="ub_quote"><span class="double-quote">&#8220;</span><p>Being a gladiator in Rome, though it could be very lucrative and you could be very, very popular, came with huge restrictions on your legal status. We don’t do that to athletes, obviously. Now, no matter how much we may disapprove of a sport &#8230; those people are celebrated.&#8221;</p><p class="author">&#8212;&nbsp; Siobhán McElduff, UBC professor of early Roman history</p></div>
<p>“Being a gladiator in Rome, though it could be very lucrative and you could be very, very popular, came with huge restrictions on your legal status,” McElduff said. “We don’t do that to athletes, obviously. Now, no matter how much we may disapprove of a sport &#8230; those people are celebrated.”</p>
<p>In Canada, perhaps none are more revered than hockey players, and McElduff said similar themes resonate in the culture of hockey.</p>
<p>“The way hockey fights are often talked about is like it’s an honour thing. If you watch <em>Hockey Night</em>, you see Don Cherry and he [says,] ‘This is a necessary thing about honour,’” she said. “This is the way that gladiators [kept] their honour or what honour they [had] left, even though they’re fighting for entertainment.”</p>
<p>National identity also plays into the parallels between hockey for Canadians and gladiators for the ancient Romans.</p>
<p>“We get that especially at big things like the Olympics,” she said. “The idea that somehow these people are representing us by taking risks. Even though some of those things like skeleton seem insane, somehow they are making us proud to be ourselves.”</p>
<p>While there was no guidebook to verify the details of real gladiators, certain communal morals seemed to be strong. Like the UBC REC event, ancient competitors faced off against people from their own school.</p>
<p>“We don’t really know, but the assumption was if you were too keen to kill people they didn’t like it,” McElduff said.</p>
<p>As a co-ed competition, the UBC REC event did hold true to the historical accuracy of ancient gladiators. Though many people believe the sport was restricted to men, McElduff said women were also involved in particularly lavish games as an “expensive speciality.”</p>
<p>In the Student Rec Centre however, female and male competitors were equally “special.” The “guaranteed laughter” was not an empty promise as players busted their guts watching their teammates bounce around inflatable obstacles like their lives depended on it. And all the enthusiasm really did paid off in the end — after the “war” was over, Dat Asterix emerged the victors in their time slot.</p>

<p>If someone had told me there was a glitch in the space-time continuum and a folk musician from the mid 1960s had materialized in the Gallery Lounge last Wednesday night, I wouldn’t have second-guessed them.</p>
<p>Rolla Olak was easily identifiable, sitting with a brass harmonica holder around his neck and a brown safari hat on his head, casually sipping a beer with bandmate John Sponarski.  </p>
<p>Moments later, Olak shouldered a worn Telecaster, quickly re-tuned it, and took a final gulp of his beer. After a brief introduction, Olak strummed the riff of his latest single “Waiting for You,” a love song about a homeless couple. The duo immediately drowned the intellectual conversations flying back and forth between an array of supercilious third- and fourth-year students, sparking a powder keg of noise, filling the room with a boot-stomping, harmonica-playing folk echo of the Vietnam era. </p>
<p>The two men managed to evoke a grandiose dynamic of sound within the Gallery. Rolla’s loud electric guitar traversed the realms of folk, country and blues, swaying between nostalgic melodies and pop chorus chord progressions. While his harmonica conjured sincere and weathered emotions of a homeless man left to rot in the streets of Nashville, Sponarski’s steel guitar gently accompanied the harmonica’s lonesome cry with its distinct sinking sound. </p>
<p>“I think growing up on Vancouver Island really influenced my writing,” Rolla said confidently after the show. “Knowing that there’s more out there in the world and the universe than just sort of what we make believe our lives to be about — those still moments really influence me.”</p>
<div id="attachment_43075" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://ubyssey.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Rolla-Olak_20140129__Kosta-Prodanovic.jpg"><img src="http://ubyssey.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Rolla-Olak_20140129__Kosta-Prodanovic-1024x685.jpg" alt="Photo Kosta Prodanovic / The Ubyssey" width="1024" height="685" class="size-large wp-image-43075" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Kosta Prodanovic / The Ubyssey</p></div>
<p>Olak, who provided much of the sountrack to the Vice documentary <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/doin-it-baja/doin-it-baja-part-1-of-8">Doin&#8217; It Baja</a>, described his style as “straight-up, like country, rock, and folk and blues. It sounds pretty old school.” It’s a familiar sound, heavily influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Tom Petty, the three of whom Rolla cited as the music he listened to while growing up on Vancouver Island. </p>
<p>“I feel like listening to them growing up is kind of like going to school: learning how to write a good pop song, learning about melody in a good pop song and learning how to be okay with writing words or poetry like Bob Dylan does.</p>
<p>“The best songs I’ve written are definitely the ones that sort of come through and you kind of just be in that moment and not try to worry where they’re coming from and get that real stream-of-consciousness style of writing.”</p>
<p>Since 2009, Olak has released two studio albums, one live album, and his latest single, “Waiting for You.” Prior to his solo career, Olak played guitar for the Canadian band Boy. Although Boy has since disbanded, Olak remains close with the lead singer, Stephen Kozmeniuk. He plans to return to Toronto in May, where Kozmeniuk will produce Rolla’s upcoming album, expected to be released this summer.</p>
<p>But Olak doesn&#8217;t necessarily need bandmates to succeed. When asked how he might he have lived in a past life, he responded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe like a wolf, or some sort of cool animal that can survive out in the wilderness by itself.”</p>
