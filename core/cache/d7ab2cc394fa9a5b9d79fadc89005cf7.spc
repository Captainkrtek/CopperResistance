<p>From time to time, we devote some column space to a little navel-gazing and discuss the wonderful world of student journalism. </p>
<p>Last year, <em>The Ubyssey</em> <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/opinion/ubyssey-cup939/" target="_blank">left the Canadian University Press</a> (CUP), an organization claiming to represent the student press across the country. We did so reluctantly, but out of necessity — the organization cost us more than $5,700 a year to be part of, and we believed we could give you, our readers, better value for your money.</p>
<p>One of the main problems with CUP is its wire service. The organization devotes more than half of its non-conference resources to paying a national bureau chief and regional bureau chiefs, including travel, training, office space and other associated costs of having a staff who supposedly operate a wire service of aggregated and original articles covering university affairs nationwide.</p>
<p>None of that is necessary. Much of what CUP publishes is aggregated from student newspapers as part of a content-sharing agreement. The rest is written by regional bureau chiefs, but it often duplicates assignments these employees have at their respective newspapers, and many bureau chiefs fail to meet their quotas. Worst of all, perhaps, is its irrelevance at student newspapers that are increasingly focusing on providing great local news, rather than trying to keep up with <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, let alone the Internet at large.</p>
<p>Another major problem is CUP’s governance structure. CUP’s president serves as its head officer, which means that instead of being the organization&#8217;s leader, she serves the board’s wishes. Presidents are elected for their vision and then bogged down by red tape. They are rarely given the freedom they need to succeed and make important changes in the organization.</p>
<p>For these reasons, most large papers in Canada have made the same decision as <em>The Ubyssey</em> to leave CUP. In fact, when <em>The Ubyssey</em> left this year, we were one of the last big papers to go, following the University of Toronto, Western, McGill, Queen&#8217;s and York.</p>
<p>So why am I talking about this now? This weekend at the organization’s annual general meeting, the editor of U of T&#8217;s <em>The Varsity</em> and I presented a plan to reunite CUP. This plan required the organization to make significant changes and cuts to maintain its membership and recruit those who have left. It was a holistic attempt to preserve CUP.</p>
<p>After several hours of debate, the proposal failed 19-15 in a vote that afforded papers at small colleges the same power as those at the University of Alberta and SFU. That the proposal failed is sad, because more student newspapers will leave the organization, frustrated with its status quo approach to fixing problems. And without CUP, it’s difficult to see its phenomenally popular and educational national conferences continuing. It won’t have the same oomph when its members are <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/opinion/a-little-student-press-solidarity856/" target="_blank">facing adversity</a>.</p>
<p>So, in an effort to create an organization that does represent the interests of student papers, <em>The Ubyssey</em> and a handful of other papers are building up the National University Wire, an organization founded at the start of this year to replace the CUP wire for papers no longer in CUP. The organization will be initially free to join and work cooperatively to build community and services as member papers. It will offer an aggregated wire service using the miracle of the Internet, instead of hundreds of hours of manpower. </p>
<p>And most importantly, it will put pressure on CUP to change. The end goal of this campaign is to unite campus newspapers and <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/opinion/last-words-april-7/" target="_blank">strengthen the campus press</a>, those tireless journalists who keep a watchful eye on campus administrators and showcase university achievement, in training to bring their skill set to wider audiences.</p>
<p>So we hope to bring you content from more campuses across Canada as more papers join the National University Wire, and we hope CUP changes, because we’ll miss it when its gone. </p>

<p><em>Dear Konrad,</p>
<p>I carpool to school with three of my friends, and the other day I just really let one go in the backseat. It was raining so we couldn&#8217;t open the windows and the heat sort of circulated it around so I didn&#8217;t think it was obviously me, but at the same time everyone in the car knew something had gone funky. How do I diffuse this awkward situation without admitting it was me?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Stinky in a Saturn</em></p>
<p>Nobody should be called out for their bodily functions. When burping, coughing or yawning, you should cover your mouth and say “excuse me.” Flatulence is a different story. It is best to excuse yourself beforehand and go to another room or the bathroom. Unfortunately Saturns, while named after the second largest planet, do not provide much personal space.</p>
<p>In this case, you did the right thing by not calling attention to it. Apologizing would make it even more awkward since nobody would know how to respond. The solution is to start a conversation or comment on something totally unrelated. This will get the whole car thinking and talking about something else. The smell will blow away almost as fast as it arrived.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">It’s hard to ruin someone’s mood with a question about food</h3>
<p><em>Dear Konrad,</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m out on my own and no longer have access to mom&#8217;s cooking I&#8217;m always looking for recipes, especially those that don&#8217;t require me to buy a pricey cookbook. I want to ask some of my Asian friends for recipes, but I can&#8217;t think of a way to ask &#8220;what do your people eat&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t sound racist in my head. Especially since some of them have lived here for three generations and I don&#8217;t know if that makes it especially presumptuous.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hungry awkward white girl</em></p>
<p>Since food is an important part of any culture, asking about its cuisine is just like asking about its arts or history. Those friends of yours who grew up in Asia or visit there often will probably see your question as a thoughtful attempt at getting to know their background. They will be happy to tell you about the foods they eat and how to make them.</p>
<p>Those whose familiarity with Asian culture are less apparent may get embarrassed or annoyed if you ask them about something they do not know about. Instead, you should take a less direct approach. Many third generation families are proud of their heritage and maintain at least some of their ancestors&#8217; traditions. You can ask your friends what they like to eat. If they grew up eating Asian food, their taste will likely reflect that. Should they mention something you’d like to try, ask for the recipe.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">One, maybe two, then you&#8217;re through</h3>
<p><em>Dear Konrad,</p>
<p>What is a nice way to say to a guy at a bar that I appreciate the free drinks all night, but never in hell would have sex with you?</p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Thirsty Thursday </em></p>
<p>Dating experts disagree on whether or not it is OK to accept drinks from someone you are not interested in. When someone buys you a drink, they are either doing it because they are attracted to you or because they want to show off. Whatever the case, as long as the person isn’t a total creep and you watch the bartender make the drink, it is acceptable to take the first one. </p>
<p>Once the guy approaches you, thank him and let him talk to you. If you’re still not interested, start dropping hints. You can say you already have a boyfriend (warning: this might annoy him if you’ve already accepted a drink), or start talking about other guys you are attracted to like your celebrity crush. After buying you one or two drinks, he should get the message and not be too disappointed. According to a recent survey, only two per cent of men have found a relationship at a bar.</p>
