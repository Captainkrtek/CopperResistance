			<p><i>Big Win Gives Stingers a Chance of Post-Season for First Time in Three Years</i></p>

			<p>After being set back their chase for the post-season Saturday afternoon in a 5-1 loss to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport no. 1-ranked McGill Martlets, Concordia was excited at their  chances against the Carleton Ravens—a team who had lost 15 straight.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>A regulation win for the Stingers would all but clinch the post-season for the first time since the 2010-11 season, when they finished third in the Réseau du Sports étudiants du Québec.</p>

	<p>They got what they were hoping for, defeating the Ravens 3-1 Sunday afternoon at Ed Meagher Arena.</p>

	<p>“The game plan was to go out and take two points away from Carleton in regulation,” said veteran forward Jaymee Shell, who got the game-winning goal and added an assist. </p>

	<p>“[We wanted] to get ahead of them in the standings so we can focus on Ottawa now.”</p>

	<p>With the win, the Stingers, who now have a 5-12-0 record, are only two points behind the Ottawa Gee Gees, who have lost six in a row, and face Concordia next Saturday afternoon at the Minto Sports Complex.</p>

	<p>The last time the Stingers made the post-season was in captain Erin Lally’s sophomore season. </p>

	<p>The Calgary-native, whose career with Concordia is nearing its end, reflects on the team she leads.</p>

	<p>“Our record so far in the season does not reflect our work ethic and dedication,” said Lally.
 “This group is one of the hardest-working teams I have been with. I think we are starting to connect and gain confidence at the perfect time.”</p>

	<p>The game itself was a great 60-minute performance for all the girls on the roster as well as an entertaining match for the fans.</p>

	<p>“The kids are happy. We’re a young team and that was our goal at the beginning of the year to make the playoffs,” said Stingers head coach Les Lawton. </p>

	<p>“We also have a shot at the number three spot. It’s going to be pretty intense the rest of the way. The next two games against Ottawa will really help our [playoff] push.”</p>

	<p>The Maroon and Gold got on the board first at the 12:34 mark of the opening frame when forward Erica Porter took advantage of a Raven defender blowing a tire in front of her net. </p>

	<p>Porter took the puck and did a wrist shot top corner past Raven goaltender Tamber Tisdale, for her first goal of the season.</p>

	<p>“I try the shot all the time in practice,” said a very excited Porter. “It’s fun to finally get the opportunities, and this time it paid off. Hopefully it’ll keep going on through to the playoffs.”</p>

	<p>The Ravens tied it up a couple of minutes later, but the game didn’t stay that way for long.</p>

	<p>Late in the first, Ravens forward Ainslee Kent was in the penalty box for a hooking call, and the Stingers power play went to work.</p>

	<p>After some good passing, rookie defender Caroll-Ann Gagné took a shot from the point and banked off the backboards right on the stick of Shell, who made no mistake putting the Stingers up for good.</p>

	<p>Rookie forward Kerianne Schofield added the much-need insurance goal with just under four minutes left in the game, having an open rebound past Tisdale. Stingers netminder Carolanne Lavoie-Pilon wasn’t really busy until late in the game, picking up 14 saves for her third win of the season.</p>

	<p>“[Almost] clinching a playoff spot gives us the opportunity to prove ourselves in the post-season,” said Lally. “Not to mention a great way to finish off my Stingers career.”</p>

	<p>Next up for the Stingers is a back-to-back weekend affair traveling to play the Ottawa Gee Gees Saturday afternoon at the Minto Sports Complex, and then hosting the McGill Martlets at Ed Meagher Arena Sunday. Puck drop Sunday is at 3:30 p.m.</p>

			<p><i>New Web Magazine Seeks To Elevate Video Game Criticism</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/articles/Screen_Shot_2014-02-03_at_11.01.54_PM.png" alt="" />
			</p>
			
			
			<p>What do you get when you cross serious critical theory with video games?</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Just ask Zolani Stewart, one of the co-founders of the online magazine <em>The Arcade Review</em>, which wields an analytical approach to the video game medium.</p>

	<p>Unlike well-known outlets such as <span class="caps">IGN</span>, <em>The Escapist</em> or <span class="caps">MMOC</span>hamp, <em>The Arcade Review</em> seeks to publish criticism on smaller, avant-garde games often not discussed in mainstream circles.</p>

	<p>Presently, most video game journalism focuses on larger-scale, triple-A and big name independent games. </p>

	<p>“A lot of the publishers like <span class="caps">IGN</span> and Polygon—the way they write about games are like product reviews,” said Stewart. </p>

	<p>Instead, <em>The Arcade Review</em> has turned to art criticism as its basis of critical theory. </p>

	<p>“[Current] games writing [is] focused on game evaluation that tells you whether it’s worth playing,” Stewart said. </p>

	<p>Rather than pay lip service to the giants of the industry, <em>The Arcade Review</em> sets out to expose the artistic side of games to an audience that may be oblivious to their existence. </p>

	<p>With this tactic, Stewart wants not only to change the face of game reviewing, but also to give the smaller games a so-called one-up.</p>


					
					
				
				
								<blockquote>
					<p>“There are games out there trying to communicate complex ideas and feelings but [are] not getting noticed by the mainstream. There’s no push behind them.” Zolani Stewart, co-creator <em>The Arcade Review</em></p>
				</blockquote>
								
				
					<p>“There are games out there trying to communicate complex ideas and feelings but [are] not getting noticed by the mainstream. There’s no push behind them,” he said.</p>

	<p>According to Stewart, this push/pull phenomenon is a result of the industry’s marketing capabilities and strategies. </p>

	<p>After all, it’s hard to take a serious microscope to an industry whose basis is ‘just-for-fun.’</p>

	<p>“Game reviewers tend to be kind of boring and sound the same. But when you talk about the weirder games, it&#8217;s more interesting,” Stewart said.</p>

	<p>A student at Vanier College, he first got the idea to create <em>The Arcade Review</em> when he discovered a blog on freeware games. </p>

	<p>He reached out to the blog’s creator Alex Bieschel and together they set out to create a digital magazine. </p>

	<p>To a non-gamer, studying video games may seem like a waste of time. However, their importance and impact on pop culture and society are just as influential as literature, film or music, said Stewart.</p>

	<p>“There isn&#8217;t a lot of criticism in the industry. It&#8217;s characteristic in the way it exploits,” said Stewart. “This is something [you see] in larger publications […] These business cycles are normalized instead of criticized.”</p>

	<p>Perhaps this is due to the industry’s relative youth or its niche appeal. But according to Stewart, this is exactly why video games should be scrutinized more closely. </p>

	<p>“There are these larger journalists who talk about the same games in the same way. But do we really know how to talk about games? No one knows how to approach it.”</p>

	<p>Like many gamers interested in the industry, Stewart is well aware of the problems within, and thinks it would be interesting to use different methods of critique to expose these issues. </p>

	<p>“I&#8217;d like to see Marxist criticism applied to the industry and games,” he said, “[The video game industry] represents [&#8230;] a lot [of] instability, exploitation of technology work.”</p>

	<p>His main focus, however, remains trained on creating open, honest critiques in contrast to the current mainstream literature on gaming. </p>

	<p>“What is really important for me is creating a critical base. To think about games in a new way that is useful. It starts with talking about smaller games. It challenges critics, and that’s exciting to read.”</p>

	<p><em>The Arcade Review</em> will be published bi-monthly, and you can check out the first issue <a href="http://arcadereview.net/">here.</a></p>

			<p><i>Stingers Lose Both Weekend Games By Large Margin</i></p>

			<p>Trying to put a couple of points in their playoff race seemed impossible for the Concordia Stingers’ men’s hockey team this past weekend as they were beaten handedly in both games, losing 6-2 to the Queens’ Gaels Friday night and then 7-2 on the following afternoon playing against the Carleton Ravens.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>“I think as a whole the weekend was lost because of a big maturity gap,” said Stingers’ head coach Kevin Figsby. “Especially when our roster is mainly first- and second-years, and the teams we faced are veteran fourth- and fifth-year guys. It cost us in the end.”</p>

	<p>Friday night versus the Gaels was a rematch of a game held at Ed Meagher Arena Jan. 18. </p>

	<p>The Gaels dominated every facet of the game, easily shutting the door on Concordia 4-0. </p>

	<p>The Stingers didn’t fare much better on that night, although it started off better. </p>

	<p>With a full house backing the Stingers, the Bees weren’t able to capitalize on their chances, though there were many.</p>

	<p>The Gaels took a 1-0 lead by the end of the first when defender Stephane Chabot scored with just over five minutes left to play in the period. </p>

	<p>They added another couple of goals in the middle period when Chris Van Laren and Jordan Soquila got goals past Stinger goaltender Antonio Mastropietro, coming off a career-high 46 saves Wednesday night.</p>

	<p>Late in the period the Stingers had a chance to get on the scoreboard with a two-man advantage for almost two full minutes but they were unable to get past Queens’ goaltender Chris Clarke, who made 24 saves in the Gaels win.  </p>

	<p>The inexperience of Figsby’s team led to the more experienced Gaels adding to their cushion, scoring a powerplay marker 25 seconds into the third, and then the heat got turned up with both sides nearly coming to blows off the ensuing faceoff.</p>

	<p>With top teams Carleton, McGill and Université de Québec à Trois-Rivières going out and signing former American Hockey League players, Figsby wanted to say he wasn’t like the rest of those squads.</p>

	<p>“We are too young a team, too poised to go out and bring in rent-a-players,” said Figsby. “That is not my vision, I want my players to commit both academically and athletically and don’t want any hockey bums who won&#8217;t dedicate themselves to both in my program.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers finally solved Clarke with two goals six minutes apart to cut the deficit to just two when forwards Dany Potvin and Taylor Lambke lit the lamp. Forward Ben Dubois assisted on both goals.</p>

	<p>“We know that we have only a few games left, and we want to give the impression that we aren’t a pushover team. We&#8217;re going to continue to work hard and compete every night,” said Dubois. </p>

	<p>Unfortunately Concordia’s comeback was all for not, and the Gaels were too much, getting two late goals in a wild game finisher, and going home 6-2 victors.</p>

	<p>Sunday afternoon the Stingers traveled across the Ottawa River for a game against the Carleton Ravens, a team that boasts an 11-1 record at the Ice House, something that was on the mind of the Stingers heading in.</p>

	<p>The Stingers were forced to use a variety of different players due to key injuries such as veteran forward Jessyco Bernard who is out with a broken jaw, and defenceman Sean Blunden with a bruised foot. </p>

	<p>It was a game of line juggling for Figsby, who opted to play with seven blueliners, including both Adam Nugent-Hopkins and Adam Strumas, both cracking the lineups after long hiatuses.</p>

	<p>“With the playoffs just around the corner we&#8217;re trying a variety of different line combinations,” said Figsby. “Unfortunately we were too uncharacteristic all week, and playing against the top teams in the country, they capitalized on us.”</p>

	<p>Despite the shots not going Concordia’s way in the first period, the Stingers managed to escape after the first 20 with a 1-0 lead when rookie forward Hugo Vincent wired a shot for his fourth goal of the season just over two minutes into the game.</p>

	<p>In the second period, it was all Ravens, scoring four goals, including three in the span of 139 seconds.</p>

	<p>The equalizing goal was a deflating one for the Stingers’ blue line. </p>

	<p>After Nugent-Hopkins made a great play, intercepting a Raven rush, he sent a breakout pass to Vincent and joined the play. </p>

	<p>His fellow defence partner also pinched, and they caught themselves flat footed. </p>

	<p>Ravens’ forward Michael McNamee got his own breakaway and beat Mastropietro to tie the game up at one-apiece.</p>

	<p>The Ravens ran away with the victory, up 6-1 late, defender Jeremy Barriault wired a shot for his second of the season on the Stingers&#8217; first powerplay of the day. The game ended with a 7-2 Carleton victory.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We happen to be the youngest team in the conference,&#8221; said Figsby after a winless week. &#8220;And we didn&#8217;t plan on these results, but when our bad decisions [make us] deviate from our game plan this is what happens.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Next up for the Stingers is a game Friday evening taking on the Ottawa Gee Gees at the Minto Sports Complex and then coming home Saturday afternoon to take on the University of Ontario Institute of Technology Ridgebacks, currently fighting them for  a higher playoff spot. Puck drop is at 2 p.m.</p>

			<p>The scoreboard showed 4-1 in favour of the Patriotes when the final horn sounded at Ed Meagher Arena on Wednesday night. The Stingers knew it could have been a lot worse. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>“They [the Patriotes] were doing a lot of what we were supposed to do,” said Stingers men’s hockey head coach Kevin Figsby after the game. “We knew it was going to be a tough game.”</p>

	<p>Entering Wednesday’s game on a two-game winning streak, the Stingers were no match for the visiting Université de Québec à Trois-Rivières Patriotes, who headed onto Concordia’s home ice ranked second in the Ontario University Athletics East Division and on an 11-game winning streak of their own.   </p>

	<p>The Patriotes overwhelmed the Stingers from the start, dominating the shot column 21-1 in the opening period. </p>

	<p>They were rewarded for their effort with two quick goals 47 seconds apart late in the period, first by winger Jason Rajotte before winger Yannick Dubé scored on a powerplay to take a 2-0 lead. </p>

	<p>Stingers goaltender Antonio Mastropietro, who made a career-high 46 saves in the loss, wasn’t surprised at the workload he faced Wednesday night, but also credits his defence for it not being worse.</p>

	<p>“I kind of knew [the number of shots] was going to be that high,” said Mastropietro. “I’ve played with a lot of those guys in the [Quebec Major Junior Hockey League], and I know they’re a very skilled team, so I expected a lot of rubber coming my way.”</p>

	<p>At just under three minutes in the second frame, Concordia forward Hugo Vincent brushed past the Patriotes defence and found a pinching blueliner of his own in Gabriel Bourret, who scored his second goal of the season past goaltender Guillaume Nadeau to cut the deficit to one.</p>

	<p>Minutes later, forward Dany Potvin had the tying goal on his stick with an open net but backhanded the puck out of play.</p>

	<p>But where Concordia failed <span class="caps">UQTR</span> succeeded, scoring two more powerplay goals before the end of the period to take a 4-1 lead into the final frame. </p>

	<p>They were goals which, if it weren’t for an injury to top line forward Jessyco Bernard, who missed the game and will be out the remainder of the season with a broken jaw, might not have found the back of the net according to Figsby. </p>

	<p>“Our number one penalty killing unit is Hinse and Bernard and now that [Bernard] is out we had to be disciplined,” Figsby said. “We weren’t, and it cost us.”</p>

	<p>The third period was quiet on the goal-scoring front. Despite <span class="caps">UQTR</span> firing another 16 shots at Mastropietro, he stopped them all and kept the game close. Concordia was only able to get their 10th shot of the game nearing midway through the final period.</p>

	<p>It was a tough loss, but not unexpected. <span class="caps">UQTR</span> currently ranks no. 6 in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport—and, with the win, move past the McGill Redmen for top spot in the division. The Stingers remain in sixth place.</p>

	<p>“From a five-on-five perspective the game was 1-1,” said Figsby. “I think our lack of discipline really let Antonio down tonight.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers next take to the ice this Friday, Jan. 31 at Ed Meagher Arena against the Queen’s University Gaels. Puck drops at 8 p.m.</p>

			<p><i>Montréal: City-State Foundation Seeks to Turn Montreal into Entrepreneur Haven</i></p>

					<p>The idea of turning Montreal into a “city-state” was pitched to an audience of about 30 in the School of Community and Public Affairs basement on Jan. 29.</p>

	<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean Montreal becoming an Athens or Sparta however, nor a stone-walled Vatican cordoned off from the rest of Quebec and Canada, but to grant Montreal its own special jurisdiction over its tax revenue and provincial services.</p>

	<p>Such a change would require consent from the Premier, as provinces hold authority over forming cities in Canada.</p>

	<p>“We use the word ‘city-state’ because we’re not trying to make a little change, we’re trying to make a big change,” said Michel David, president of the <a href="http://www.montrealcitystate.ca/" target="_blank">Montréal: City-State Foundation</a> and associate for the business consulting firm Coaching Ourselves Network.</p>

	<p>David argued in his presentation that Montreal could become an “entrepreneurial economy” if it could design its own tax code and was not subject to provincial oversight.</p>

	<p>In the next three months, he said, the Montréal: City State team will begin fleshing out how they can make this dream a reality.</p>

	<p>“When you study the situation of Montreal, there is one overarching fact,” said David. “We are the poorest city in North America; this has been surveyed and documented for years.”</p>

	<p>Despite being known as a world-class city, this lack of prosperity is, according to David, in part due to a lack of attention from the provincial government.</p>

	<p>“For the last 40 years we’ve had a one-segment policy, and that one segment is the rest of Quebec,” said David, noting he thinks the island of Montreal is seen as a threat by the Parti Québécois and is not given policy priority because of it being a Liberal Party of Quebec stronghold.</p>

	<p>“We have no clout, nowhere with nobody,” said David. “[We] just get pushed to the wall.”</p>

	<p>Free from provincial oversight on health care and education, David says Montreal could ensure that students were bilingual after elementary school, and trilingual by the end of high school, closer to the European model.</p>

	<p>David’s plan would also look to make Montreal the gateway to commerce with both Europe and Africa because of its linguistic advantage. </p>

	<p>As Toronto is known for finance, Calgary for energy and Vancouver for pacific shipping, David argues Montreal could become a destination for entrepreneurs, like a northern Silicon Valley, with a tax system that would balance its budget and be attractive for private business.</p>

	<p>While Montreal matched those cities in the ‘60s in terms of economic prosperity, its growth measured by G.D.P. has been outpaced by about one per cent since—leading our city to become a “frog to debt,” according to David.</p>

	<p>It’s an analogy that Montreal is a frog sitting in a frying pan filled with water. As the water heats up slowly, the frog falls asleep—only to be later boiled alive.</p>

	<p>“One per cent per year, you don’t really notice it. But after 30 years that’s 30 per cent, and that’s what’s happened,” he said.</p>

					<p>During the days of the <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/3050">historic Quebec student strike</a> of 2012, protesters, detractors, media analysts and those caught in the crossfires of nightly and often violent marches routinely debated the right of students to strike—over 18 months later Jonathan Bouchard says that hasn’t changed much.</p>

	<p>“It is safe to say that we are at crossroads today regarding the student’s right to strike,” said the representative of Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec, the largest student interest group in the province, during a panel discussion hosted by Concordia University’s School of Community and Public Affairs on Monday evening.</p>

	<p>About 40 people attended the event at the Samuel Bronfman Centre. </p>

	<p>Joining Bouchard on the panel were Benjamin Gingras, <span class="caps">UQAM</span> student and spokesperson of the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante, Adrienne Gibson, member of the Quebec Bar Association, who worked as a union advisor and Pascale Dufour, associate professor in political science at Université de Montréal who is studying social movements in comparative politics.</p>

	<p>“When it comes to giving the state the responsibility of determining what the strike is, how it’s done, it’s extremely risky,” said Gingras. </p>

	<p>“There’s clear state interference with how students organize.”</p>

	<p>Although he says the “ideal way to go” for students is to not have their power to strike regulated, Bouchard is concerned that injunctions have now become a precedent.</p>

	<p>“A new strike would have that in mind where injunctions are possible and injunctions do work,” he says. “If there is another strike, it will be in society’s minds that individual actions can be more important than collective decisions.” </p>

	<p>According to Dufour, there are both positives and negatives to legislating a student strike.</p>

	<p>“If you have the legal right to strike, you will be giving power to judges […] <br />
the management of the strike will take place in court,” she said, adding the current legislation’s lack of clarity might be advantageous to students because it allows them to push the limits of what strike tactics they can employ without breaking the law.</p>

	<p>Dufour suggested that each student association negotiate contracts with their university. </p>

	<p>“The benefit of working with the universities and the unions would be that you’re not dealing with the government,” agreed Gibson. “The flip side is that it is not going to be evenly distributed [among universities].” </p>

	<p>“It could be an interesting focus for the student groups at this time,” she added.</p>

			<p><i>Cinema Politica McGill Screens Documentary about Unorthodox Ex-Professor</i></p>

			<h3>Seven years after being fired by McGill, Professor Norman Cornett returned to the university on Thursday evening—not to teach a class, but as the subject of a feature-length documentary film and a special guest of Cinema Politica.</h3>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

<em>Professor Norman Cornett: “Since When Do We Divorce the Right Answer from an Honest Answer?”</em> was released in 2009 and was filmed when Cornett was an invited guest speaker at Concordia. Directed by award-winning Abenaki filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin, it opens with the professor leading students through a rendition of Pink Floyd’s iconic anti-establishment song “Another Brick in the Wall.” </p>

	<p>There are clips of Cornett at work, as he makes students listen to music blindfolded or write rambling stream-of-consciousness reflections while sitting in front of a painting in a gallery. These clips are interspersed with testimonial-like interviews with sympathetic former students and colleagues.</p>

	<p>“He made me realize […] that I had never had a good teacher before, and that I wasn’t really engaged in quality education,” said Sara Gidding, one student interviewed in the film.</p>

	<p>“It was almost, ‘How long can this go on?’ It was almost like a secret. You didn’t want anyone in the administration to find out how wonderful these classes are, because they’ll take it away from you,” said another student, Leon Mwotia.</p>

	<p>“It’s like a slumber party, you know. Sooner or later the parents are going to knock on the door and say, ‘Okay, that’s it, enough. Everyone pipe down. It’s done.’”</p>

	<p>The axe did finally fall in 2007. After 15 years of teaching, the religious studies professor was unceremoniously ordered to pack up his things and get out.</p>

	<p>According to Cornett, McGill never revealed the grounds for his dismissal. The administration’s only public statement on the matter consists of an open letter in Le Devoir by then-Executive Vice-Principal Anthony Masi, who is now provost. </p>

	<p>The letter, titled “McGill honore la liberté d’expression”—or “McGill honors freedom of expression”—did not explain why Cornett was let go but denied allegations that it was because of “the controversial debates on the Middle East conflict that he organized in his classes.” </p>

	<p>In an interview with <em>The Link</em> after the screening, Cornett said his firing had surprised him. He also defended his sometimes-demanding teaching style. </p>

	<p>“I think it’s important to point out that all of the classes I taught were electives,” said Cornett. “Nobody had to take the classes and, at the very first day, I made it clear this is unlike other courses. But the payoff is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced.”</p>

	<p>Aside from his unorthodox method of conducting his “theatre of learning,” Cornett was also remarkable for both the quantity and quality of guests he had managed to bring in to speak to his students while at McGill: former prime minister Paul Martin, former Reform Party of Canada leader Preston Manning, former premier Lucien Bouchard, jazz pianist Oliver Jones and Obomsawin herself, just to name a few.</p>

	<p>“Yes, we worked very hard, but how often are you going to get to go one-on-one with the prime minister of Canada, one-on-one with the premier of Quebec, one-on-one with Academy Award nominee Ethan Hawke? And we did this not just every year, not just every semester; we did this every week,” he said in a characteristically dramatic tone.</p>

	<p>“And that’s why people of this calibre came in, because they realized that what was happening happens nowhere else.”</p>

					<p>“Yes, we worked very hard, but how often are you going to get to go one-on-one with the prime minister of Canada, one-on-one with the premier of Quebec, one-on-one with Academy Award nominee Ethan Hawke?”<br />
<em>— Professor Norman Cornett</em></p>
				</blockquote>
								
				
					<p>After the screening, during a question-and-answer session that ran longer than the film, Cornett remarked that the purpose of education is not to help students get a job, but to help them “get a life.”</p>

	<p>“University education as originally conceived was […] certainly not vocational,” Cornett later told <em>The Link</em>. “The undergrad degree is aimed at informing and forming the well-rounded citizen.</p>

	<p>“In fact, I refer to the goal of undergraduate education as, what I call, acquiring peripheral vision,” he continued. “That’s learning to see, what I call, the big picture.”</p>

	<p>At one point, Cornett said he was looking forward to an upcoming “commission” on higher education to be overseen by Pierre Duchesne, Quebec’s minister of higher education, research, science and technology. </p>

	<p>When asked to clarify, Cornett responded that he had meant to say “consultation” instead of “commission,” although no major reassessment of university education has been announced since last year’s Summit on Higher Education, which resulted in tuition fees being indexed to the annual rise in Quebec families’ disposable income.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless, Cornett spoke fondly of the 2012 student protests, likening it to his own experience at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s. Over that decade, the university was home to student protests for civil rights and free speech, and against the war in Vietnam. </p>

	<p>Cornett said the Maple Spring was a step in the right direction, but insisted a lot of work remains to be done. </p>

	<p>“I believe the Maple Spring was the beginning. It was the ‘presenting problem.’ But if we’re really going to make a difference in Quebec education, we’ve got to go ad fontes, we’ve got to go back to the sources,” he said.  </p>

	<p>“We’ve got to look at renewal and reform from root and branch, from the beginning right through to higher education.”</p>

	<p>Lately, Cornett said he has been keeping busy as a guest lecturer at schools all over Europe and North America. He also writes, translates and continues to offer his trademark dialogic sessions to the public when he is in town.</p>

	<p>And, of course, he hinted that he may have some big names lined up to join him.</p>

	<p>“For me, it became very important to continue the dialogic tradition of bringing the very best to the [greatest] number of people,” he said. </p>

			<p><i>Concordia Officials Explain their Opposition to the Proposed Charter of Values</i></p>

			<h3>The outside temperature may have been hovering around a frigid minus-20 degrees Celsius in Quebec City last Thursday, but the heat was turned up on Concordia officials at the National Assembly as they faced tough questions while presenting the university’s stance on the Parti Québécois’ proposed Charter of Values.</h3>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and VP Academic Affairs, and Roger Côté, VP Services, presented the university’s position on the charter to the provincial parliamentary committee examining Bill 60, also known as the Charter of Quebec Values. Concordia is the first university to present at the hearings.</p>

	<p>Bacon explained that Concordia opposes the charter because of the university’s particular history and identity as a diverse institution, the anticipated impact of the charter on the recruitment and retention of students and professors, and the democratic principle of academic freedom.</p>

	<p>“It is true that certain elements of the bill—notably the affirmation of the principles of the secular state and the equality of men and women—elicit firm support from the Board of Directors and Senate,” Bacon told the committee, reading from the university’s official statement on the charter.</p>

	<p>“We are, however, concerned about other key elements of the bill, such as the measures prohibiting employees of the university from wearing religious symbols, as well as the ministerial supervision of our policies on religious accommodation.”</p>

	<p>If passed, the charter would ban public sector employees—including those working for government departments, state-subsidized daycare centres, schools, colleges, universities, hospitals and municipalities—from wearing “ostentatious” religious symbols such as turbans, hijabs, niqabs, kippas and large crosses. Bacon said such a ban could hamper the university’s ability to attract and retain talented students and professors.</p>

	<p>“We worry that the negative repercussions of Bill 60 will impact not only those people who, in accordance with their religious beliefs, express their faith every day, but equally those who, for intellectual and moral reasons, would object to such restrictions,” he said.</p>

	<p>According to Bacon, Concordia’s stance on the charter was the result of a “vast consultation” that took place with the approval of the university’s Board of Governors and Senate, its senior academic body. He added that the university’s official position has the support of 11 student associations and labour unions at Concordia.</p>

	<p>“We talked a lot about the charter at Concordia during the fall of last year,” said Bacon. “As of the initial presentation of the secularism charter in September, a number of our community’s members let us know very, very quickly of their concerns.”</p>

	<p>The Concordia administration received over 200 email messages about the charter.</p>

	<p>“Ninety-eight per cent of the messages that we received rejected the charter principally, predominantly—in fact, almost exclusively—because of the ban on wearing religious symbols considered ‘ostentatious,’” he said.</p>

	<p><strong>Making a Case for Religious Symbols in the Classroom</strong></p>

	<p>During the question period that followed Bacon’s presentation of the university’s position, Democratic Institutions Minister Bernard Drainville asked Bacon and Côté to respond to comments sociologist Guy Rocher made at the parliamentary committee on Jan. 21.</p>

	<p>Rocher had said there’s been a “more or less general consensus” for a long period of time that university professors should refrain from promoting their political and religious beliefs in the classroom.</p>

	<p>“It’s not a step backward [to allow employees to wear religious symbols], it’s the present-day situation,” responded Bacon. “And for us, it’s working very, very well.”</p>

	<p>Drainville pushed for an explanation, adding, “It’s not because a practice is in place that it’s necessarily desirable.”</p>

	<p>“Minister, we all have a heritage; we all have convictions; we all have personal opinions that are discernible either from our appearance or very, very rapidly from our discourse,” Bacon responded.</p>

	<p>“Religious symbols that are considered ‘ostentatious’ are but one of the many indicators of our origins or opinions. Others can be the name of the person, their accent, the colour of their skin, the way that they choose to dress, what’s scrawled across their T-shirt, et cetera. We can’t dissociate the teaching from the person that’s doing it.”</p>

	<p>Drainville next cited Martine Desjardins, the former president of the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec, who led the organization at the time of the 2012 student protests.</p>

	<p>Now a representative of the pro-secularism group Rassemblement pour la laïcité, Desjardins told the parliamentary committee on Jan. 21 that the problem with professors wearing religious symbols is that students cannot criticize a professor’s religious beliefs as they might criticize political beliefs openly expressed by the professor to the class.</p>

	<p>Asked to respond, Bacon said the proportion of university courses directly dealing with the topic of religion is “very, very small.”</p>

	<p>“There are large sections of knowledge in engineering, in business, in science that do not touch questions of religion at all,” he said. “We can’t say: ‘There are certain symbols considered ostentatious that are not allowed; other symbols, those ones, we tolerate them.’</p>

	<p>“T-shirts of Che Guevara continue to be permitted. That doesn’t stop people from talking about revolution or communism, and that doesn’t stop students from criticizing them. Universities are about a plurality of points of view.”</p>

	<p>Asked by Drainville if Concordia students could write exams with their faces covered by religious headgear, Côté said yes, so long as the identity of the individual is confirmed first.</p>

	<p>“We aren’t comfortable refusing an education to someone who has the capacity [to learn],” Bacon added.</p>

	<p>There were more friendly exchanges between Concordia’s representatives and two Liberal <span class="caps">MNA</span>s sitting on the parliamentary committee. Kathleen Weil—the Liberal <span class="caps">MNA</span> for the riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, which includes Concordia’s Loyola campus—asked how Concordia deals with its diversity and the issue of state secularism.</p>

	<p>“I believe that one of the successful elements of the harmony that exists at our university—it’s respect, the respect of the individuals amongst us, recognizing our differences but recognizing that [this diversity] is a strength that benefits the learning process of [students] at the university,” said Côté, adding that eliminating such diversity would “weaken the experience, the value of the experience at the university.”</p>

	<p>Asked by Liberal <span class="caps">MNA</span> Rita de Santis how much it would cost the university and other institutions to challenge the charter in court if they decided to do so in the future, Côté responded that the scenario was “perhaps a little hypothetical for the moment.”</p>

	<p>“We’re taking advantage of the occasion and the invitation that we received […] to come give our opinion, share our point of view. We hope to receive the attention of the government, and I think that we’ll keep to that for the moment,” Côté said.</p>

	<p>Coalition Avenir Québec <span class="caps">MNA</span> Nathalie Roy asked Concordia’s officials if the university has statistics on the number of employees who would be affected by a ban on religious symbols.</p>

	<p>“Those types of statistics, we don’t collect them. We don’t ask employees of the university, when hiring them—nor students for that matter—what their religious affiliation is or other opinions,” Côté answered. “So we don’t have numbers. But experiencing Concordia, it’s evident that there’s a lot of diversity.”</p>

			<p><i>Unexpected Costs Thwart CSU Pledge To Meet $155,000-Budget</i></p>

			<h3>In spite of announcing an anticipated surplus and the first potential profit ever for Reggie’s student bar, another promise made by this year’s Concordia Student Union won’t be kept as the fall Orientation was over-budget, again, by almost $19,000.</h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

“The best way to explain why Orientation was so over-budget is because we had a lot of students turn out,” said VP Finance Scott Carr.</p>

	<p>Carr delivered a report to <span class="caps">CSU</span> council last week on the financial state of the union, indicating the union currently held a surplus of $591,527 and projected a surplus of $9,699 over 2013-2014.</p>

	<p>However, despite telling <em>The Link</em> multiple times since last June that Orientation would not go over budget like years past, he also admitted unforeseen costs and taxes on international entertainment acts—discovered after the budget had been set—made this impossible.</p>

	<p>“We had a lot of buffers, but there are a lot things that just aren’t planned for, which comes from a lot of students coming out and a lot of things that we need to then account for because we don’t have enough stock,” he said. </p>

	<p>Financial records obtained from the <span class="caps">CSU</span> list Orientation as costing $173,190, whereas it was projected to cost $155,000 at the beginning of the academic year.</p>

	<p>According to Carr, the two-week welcome-back extravaganza also generated $127,448 in revenues, largely from tickets sold to Froshapalooza—the festival-style electronic and dance music concert in Parc Jean-Drapeau headlined by artists Dada Life and Tommy Trash.</p>

	<p>But because of high attendance, employees had to work longer and more food and supplies needed to be purchased at the last minute, explained VP Student Life Katrina Caruso, who oversaw Orientation plans. </p>

	<p>“We didn’t entirely realize how much we were spending while we were doing it, because it’s hard to keep track of everything,” said Caruso. “It wasn’t like Scott was sitting at the office crunching numbers.” </p>

	<p>Federal taxes on foreign entertainment artists were also not known nor factored into the budget upon booking Dada Life and Tommy Trash, Carr and Caruso also said.</p>
					
					
				
				
								<blockquote>
					<p>“You know, last minute extra stuff happens, and it was worthwhile [to incur the expense] to keep all the events running smoothly.” _—CSU VP Student Life Katrina Caruso</p>
				</blockquote>
								
				
					<p>“The overall cost of the artists was expensive and then we add taxes on top of that which make it more expensive, and those are large costs we need to incur,” said Carr. “So that led to a large part of the budget [being taken up] but it was also the fact there were a lot of people that came [to events].”</p>

	<p>When asked how the tax on international artists was not accounted for—the union usually books headliners from around the world every year for Orientation—Carr said his upcoming six-month financial review is looking at addressing such oversights so this can’t happen again.</p>

	<p>As for Caruso, she says that in retrospect she would have considered booking only one headlining artist from outside Canada instead of two, and also would have looked to cut costs by trimming down Orientation in other ways.</p>

	<p>“I think, in general, Orientation could be a few less days and that would have saved us some money,” she said.</p>

	<p>“It ran for two weeks […] but some people, myself included, feel that Orientation could be more successful if it’s just one week,” she continued, adding that it would allow the union to do away with less successful events and focus only on activities that appeal to more students.</p>

	<p>However, Caruso added she still thinks spending more is worthwhile when students are coming out to reap the benefit.</p>

	<p>“I think it’s worth it. I think ideally, costs attributed to Orientation are worth [spending] because the <span class="caps">CSU</span> can reach its members,” she said.</p>

	<p>“You know, last minute extra stuff happens, and it was worthwhile [to incur the expense] to keep all the events running smoothly.”</p>

	<p><em>A previous version of this article erroneously stated the union was projecting a surplus of $591,527 over the 2013-2014 academic year, when that amount is the current surplus of revenues over expenses for the <span class="caps">CSU</span>; the actual projected end-of-year surplus is $9,699.</em> The Link <em>regrets the error.</em></p>

			<p><i>Concordia Library to Undergo Major Renovations Amid Shrinking Book Borrowing</i></p>

			<h3>Guylaine Beaudry, the chief administrator for Concordia’s two libraries, says the Webster Library is stuck in the past—but upcoming renovations aim to bring it into the digital age.</h3>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

“The current library we have is really based on the model of the mid-19th century library,” said the interim university librarian, who was director of the Webster Library from 2009 until June of last year. “We think that, with this shift from print to digital culture, it is time to revise our brick-and-mortar space.”</p>

	<p>Preliminary plans for the renovation of the Webster Library are now complete, and a consultation process will soon begin to hear what students and faculty members would want from a modernized library.</p>

	<p>“[The preliminary plans are] the representation of a vision,” said Beaudry. “The planning of the project is not complete, but we felt [it is time] to announce the project because we want to start a consultation phase with students, with faculty members, and it’s not when the final plans will be done that it’ll be time to start the consultation.”</p>

	<p>Assuming the final plans are approved by the university’s Board of Governors, the bidding process to determine who will be awarded the construction contract could take place in September and construction could begin in January 2015, according to Beaudry. At a rate of approximately one floor per year, all of the renovations are expected to be completed by the end of 2017.</p>

	<p>Beaudry said a lot of time, energy and money have been spent since 2000 on building the library’s digital resources and the university must now look to “create an intellectually stimulating space that will also promote discourse and critical thinking.”</p>

	<p>According to Beaudry, 675,000 books were borrowed every year on average at Concordia’s two libraries until the end of the 2000s. Since then, she says, the annual average has dropped to 450,000, mirroring similar trends at academic libraries across the country.</p>

	<p>Beaudry insists the library is “not giving up on print.” Still, she says the next-generation library is “a space for active and collaborative learning, an on-campus social learning environment.” One of the goals of the renovations will be to make the library more comfortable, quiet, bright and convenient for students to study or read in, according to a university document provided by Beaudry.</p>

	<p>Beaudry says student surveys suggest many are dissatisfied with the amount of study space at the Webster Library and that many students also feel the library is too noisy. The noise is probably related to the lack of space, according to Beaudry.</p>

	<p>“In 1992, when we opened the building, [Concordia] had 16,000 students, compared to 46,000 now, so you don’t have to look very far to understand what happened,” she said.</p>

	<p>The preliminary plans for the renovations call for the number of seats at the Webster Library to double and then some, from 1,500 to 3,300. The library will also be expanded to include the fifth floor of the J.W. McConnell Building that houses it, increasing its space by 27 per cent.</p>

	<p>In terms of square footage, Concordia’s Webster and Vanier libraries currently offer the lowest amount of space per student compared to other Canadian university libraries, according to university documents provided to <em>The Link.</em></p>

	<p>“The numbers are telling us that, yes, it’s a good decision to invest in the expansion of the library,” Beaudry said.</p>

	<p>The angular walls seen in the architectural renderings of the renovated library plans were inspired by origami, according to Beaudry. There will be a variety of study spaces, including classrooms, silent study halls, social areas, group study rooms and even rooms where students can practice for oral presentations by filming themselves and playing back the recordings to see how they can improve.</p>

	<p>Beaudry said a new zero-noise room will be completely quiet since students won’t even be allowed to use the room to work on laptops—after all, keyboards are not entirely silent.</p>

	<p>Reserved rooms with a total of 80 seats will also be made available to graduate students, giving them a dedicated space in which to write their dissertations.</p>

	<p>“It is a space that, I think, will be most appreciated,” Beaudry said. “It is a time when the graduate students find themselves isolated because they have to work at home. Sometimes they don’t have the best conditions at home to write their six pages every day.”</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, a “technology sandbox” will allow students in computer science to test applications they’ve created on different mobile devices. There will also be 3-D printers and cameras. </p>

	<p>“What we would like to take place in that space is interdisciplinary projects,” Beaudry said.</p>

	<p>As for the classrooms in the library, one of them will even use virtual reality to project renderings onto multiple walls.</p>

	<p>Additionally, Beaudry said she hopes that new room-booking software will make it easier and faster for students to reserve group study rooms. </p>

	<p>“My dream is to provide one [application] for all group study rooms on campus, and not only the libraries’ ones,” she said.</p>

	<p>Beaudry added the library intends to get students involved throughout the renovations. In March, students will be invited to try out different furniture samples and share their comments, Beaudry said. Periodic project updates will keep the Concordia community informed about the progress on the construction.</p>

	<p>According to Beaudry, renovations are taking place or have already been completed at many academic and public libraries throughout Canada, not just at Concordia.</p>

	<p>“I’m very proud to be able to offer to Concordia students what they deserve,” she said. “Twenty years ago, it was a major achievement to offer to the community the Webster Library, and now we’re very lucky to be in a position to [&#8230;] improve the space, to make a difference.”</p>

			<p>Though it took them a while to get it off the ground, the administration has done an excellent job of standing up for Concordia’s values.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Provost and VP Academic Affairs Benoit-Antoine Bacon and VP Services Roger Côté represented our university at the National Assembly last Thursday, deftly handling the frequently obtuse, if polite, questions leveled at them by Bill 60’s author, Democratic Institutions Minister Bernard Drainville.</p>

	<p>They were there to present Concordia’s stance against the Charter of Quebec Values, in the public hearings to take the pulse of Quebec society on an issue that has been subject to a consistently polarizing tone—even for Quebec.</p>

	<p>Although Concordia could have come out with its official position sooner, their long deliberation process has made their argument nearly airtight. The administration says they received about 200 emails with an opinion on the proposed charter—with about 98 per cent rejecting the ban on so-called “ostentatious religious symbols,” according to Bacon. </p>

	<p>Students, faculty, employees and various groups at Concordia have been vocal with their concerns about such a ban since plans for the charter were announced last fall. Concordia listened to those concerns, and Bacon and Côté communicated them to the government with poise and confidence.</p>

	<p>Bacon seemed quietly intent on dispelling the myth of the angry, unreasonable student, an image that has unfortunately haunted the idea of student opposition in Quebec even before the 2012 strike. In keeping with this attitude, he and Côté repeatedly refused to play into labelling games, saying that they didn’t know how many students or staff bore so-called ostentatious religious symbols.</p>

	<p>We don’t have any reason to keep such data. As the two told Drainville, it’s irrelevant—the university has never received any complaints over religious symbols on campus.</p>

	<p>Concordia is a model for the peaceful functioning of a diverse community, spanning a wide variety of countries of origin, faith, generation and ideology—something that Drainville would have known had he <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/5137">bothered to show up</a> to the planned charter debate last semester.</p>

	<p>Bacon and Côté hammered home the point that “diversity is our strength,” and that we are not in the business of denying anyone an education who has the capacity for it. Concordia’s history is one of a diverse student body, and continues to be. That nearly half of Concordia students are the first in their family to go to university according to Bacon, and that our academic community has about 150 different countries of origin, attests to this fact.</p>

	<p>Religious symbols are but one of many signifiers of our identities, and to single out symbols that you are part of a religious minority does nothing to create a more equal society—it does just the opposite. </p>

	<p>When <span class="caps">MNA</span> Françoise David mentioned she was opposed to a teaching environment where niqabs are allowed—ostensibly on the basis of feminism—Bacon read from an eloquent message the Simone de Beauvoir Institute sent to Concordia’s Board of Directors shortly after the charter was formally introduced, calmly exposing the flaws in her reasoning. </p>

	<p>In its message, the Institute exposed the fact that a charter that dictates what women can and cannot wear, and that further marginalizes disenfranchised women, cannot be called feminist. </p>

	<p>Taking care to continuously bring voices from the Concordia community to the commission’s attention—rather than relying solely on the administration’s point of view—Bacon and Côté demonstrated that students, faculty and the higher-ups can in fact band together. </p>

	<p>It’s not only a heartening change from Concordia’s administrative history, it’s also a demonstration of how Concordia can handle assaults on its essential character in the future—calmly, compassionately and resolutely.</p>

			<p><i>The Legal Right to Strike Isn’t a Death Sentence for Future Movements</i></p>

			<p>During the 2012 student strike the word “boycott” was thrown around by those opposing it, in contrast to those who saw the legitimacy of student action and referred to it as a strike. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The language surrounding the movement was used as a way to undermine the actions of striking students, and headlines were splashed with phrases condemning the action.</p>

	<p>The student movement born out of the planned $1,625 hike in tuition fees brought to light once again the fragility of the supposed right for students to strike in Quebec. The right to strike as it stands now is largely the result of decades of social consensus that it is an appropriate action for students to take if circumstance requires it, meaning that it is not specifically codified in the law.</p>

	<p>This creates a dangerous situation where the right for students to strike exists in a sort of legal limbo—it’s legal because there is nothing explicitly outlawing it. Further, the injunctions some students chose to have issued when their classes were blocked show the limitations of student associations that do not have legislation specifically permitting them to strike.</p>

	<p>Quebec student associations fall under Law 32, legislation that outlines the rights and responsibilities of students and how they are represented, but this legislation fails to include any information on the right to strike.</p>

	<p>Similarly, the Act Respecting the Accreditation and Financing of Students’ Associations outlines the responsibilities of student associations, and includes sections that clarify that the role of an association is to promote the interests of students and represent them. </p>

	<p>While this suggests that if students were to vote for a strike an association would be mandated to follow that directive, this act also lacks information on the right for students to strike.</p>

	<p>The 2012 student movement saw legitimate concerns on both sides about the manner in which the general assemblies that determined whether or not an association would strike were carried out. Questions about the method of voting (a show of hands, in many cases), as well as the quorum of the assemblies, were raised by both those supporting and those against the strike.</p>

	<p>The Quebec Labour Code specifies that a strike may only be declared provided that a secret ballot has determined by majority vote that it is what workers want. The same should go for student associations. </p>

	<p>If the right to strike is to be defined in the legal sense, as it should be, then student associations in the province need to universally move beyond hand-raising to show support—or lack thereof—for something like a strike.</p>

	<p>Creating a legal framework for the right to strike would likely require a majority vote in order for action to be taken, but for Concordia this would mean that close to 18,000 students would have to vote in favour of a strike. </p>

	<p>History has shown that getting that many students to get out and vote at all, let alone for the same thing, is simply not possible.</p>

	<p>Thus, what should instead be necessary is a majority vote by the quorum required for student government elections. In the case of Concordia, this would be 2.5 per cent of undergraduates. </p>

	<p>While this represents a small fraction of the student population, it is also a more realistic goal that would not leave student associations crippled by legislation that makes strike action utterly impossible due to forces outside <br />
of its control, like the continuing problem of voter apathy on campuses.</p>

	<p>During the 2012 student movement, critics of the word “strike” pointed to the fact that, unlike paid labourers, students do not necessarily produce goods or services for the public in the same way, and as a result the word “boycott” is more appropriate for the actions of students. </p>

	<p>Students and labourers should not necessarily be lumped together into the same category because they are not the same, and legislation outlining the right for students and workers to strike should take into consideration the intricate differences between both groups. </p>

	<p>However, just like workers, students are vulnerable to changes and can be taken advantage of; the legal right to strike protects them from being exploited and gives them power that can be used to ensure their well-being.</p>

	<p>Like with a union, student associations are the representatives of individuals at an institution. It is imperative that they are able to adequately advocate for accessible education, and that if there is a threat to this accessibility appropriate actions can be taken.</p>

	<p>Creating the legal right for students to strike would not necessarily do away with those who refused to respect the decisions reached at general assemblies across the province, but it would go a long way in further legitimizing student strike actions.</p>

	<p>Strikes are complicated and often divisive, and even with legislation granting students the legal right to strike there will still be those who refuse to recognize the democratically reached decisions of their peers. </p>

	<p>However, by creating a set of laws defining the right to strike, one more safeguard will be put in place to ensure that students are not taken advantage of and that accessible education remains a priority.</p>

			<p>Consistent inconsistency has been the Stingers men’s hockey team theme thus far in the new year.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>For a team that had been consistently losing to start the season, that’s a step in the right direction.</p>

	<p>Entering the winter break, the Stingers were barely clinging to the eighth and final playoff spot with a 4-8-3 record. </p>

	<p>Following this past weekend’s wins, they now sit comfortably in sixth place with an 8-10-3 record.</p>

	<p>Hitting the road for this past weekend’s games, the Stingers first travelled to North Bay, Ont. to take on the Nipissing Lakers on Friday night.  </p>

	<p>The Stingers scored in the first minute of the game when Dany Potvin solved Laker goaltender Kirk Rafuse 49 seconds in. The Lakers, were relentless, however, scoring two goals before the end of the first period when forwards Matt Paton and Craig Campbell both found the back of the net to make it 2-1. </p>

	<p>The Stingers, meanwhile, were resilient, with winger Ben Dubois tying the game with just under five minutes left in regulation. </p>

	<p>After overtime proved fruitless the teams went to a shootout, which the Stingers took by a 2-1 margin as rookie Hugo Vincent and captain George Lovatsis both got shots past the Lakers goalie.</p>

	<p>&#8220;From the start of the second period and through the game our momentum kept building, and we saw that they could not match our speed,” said Stingers head coach Kevin Figsby. “They were trying to play a short bench and we were rolling four lines and six defence, and they couldn&#8217;t match our intensity.”</p>

	<p>Saturday evening started off on the wrong skate for Concordia as Laurentian Voyageurs forward Dylan Fitze beat Antonio Mastropietro just six seconds into the contest.</p>

	<p>It didn’t faze the Stingers, however. </p>

	<p>Late in the first period, while on the powerplay, sophomore and standout Olivier Hinse scored his team-leading 16th goal of the season to tie the game at 1-1. </p>

	<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very happy from our weekend&#8217;s performances,&#8221; said Hinse. &#8220;Everybody has been working really hard and everybody is contributing. [Personally] I had a very good weekend and it&#8217;s great confidence [to have] heading into the playoffs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In the second period, the Stingers and Voyageurs battled a closer game up until the 8:34 mark when Vincent found the back of the net, giving Concordia a 2-1 lead.</p>

	<p>After Laurentian tied the game at two-apiece, Vincent and his linemates, Nicholas Samoluk and Francis Beauregard, were at it again. This time, Samoluk scored past Voyageurs goaltender Alain Valiquette for his first-career <span class="caps">CIS</span> goal to make it 3-2 in the second period.  </p>

	<p>The third period was one won by Laurentian in the shot department, but when it came to goals, Concordia amped up the pressure by scoring three additional goals.</p>

	<p>Veteran defender Sean Blunden rounded out the scoring, getting his team&#8217;s sixth and final goal of the evening with just under three minutes to go.</p>

	<p>The Stingers’ goaltending wasn&#8217;t an issue as Mastropietro was solid, turning aside 31 saves and helping give his team a four-point cushion over seventh-place University of Ontario Institute of Technology.</p>

	<p>“[Mastropietro] made every key save as all critical points in the game and allowed us to build our momentum,” Figsby said.</p>

	<p>Next up for the Stingers is a Wednesday evening match-up against the red-hot Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières Patriotes, currently riding an 11-game winning streak and in second place in the Ontario University Athletics East Division. Puck-drop is at 7 p.m. at Ed Meagher Arena.</p>

			<p><i>&#8216;The Best Point Guard in the Conference’ Has Stingers Back in the Playoff Race </i></p>

			<p>A 6-foot-tall point guard, the Stingers’ Adam Chmielewski was overshadowed in more ways than one last season by teammates Kyle Desmarais and Evens Laroche.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Standing at 6-2 and 6-4, respectively, Desmarais and Laroche didn’t only overshadow Chmielewski physically—they were also All-Canadians, the faces of Concordia’s men’s basketball team. Each finished with a team-high 15 points per game. Chmielewski, despite leading the team in minutes played, averaged just 9.2.    </p>

	<p>One year later, there is no more Desmarais and Laroche, who both left at the end of last season. The new face of the Stingers is that of Chmielewski’s, who currently leads the team not only in minutes played, but also in averaged points per game, free throws scored and steals.  </p>

	<p>It has all helped see the Stingers bounce back from a terrible 0-3 start to the season to get back in the playoff race as they now sit in third place in the Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec conference with a 6-4 record.   </p>

	<p>But with a bigger role come bigger responsibilities in the less tangible side of the game for Chmielewski. </p>

	<p>“More is asked from me in terms of leadership,” he said.</p>

	<p>“I have to always be focused, to make sure other guys are focused.”</p>

	<p>Entering Saturday’s game, Chmielewski was the only player in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport to average 15 points, five rebounds and five assists per game. His play has drawn great praise from his coaches. </p>

	<p>“He’s a Division I talent and he’s showing it this year,” said Stingers assistant coach Rastko Popovic. </p>

	<p>“The potential was always there, and [his] confidence and belief are there now. [Adam] has been tremendous on and off the floor for our team.”</p>

	<p>Stingers head coach John Dore took his praise one step further. </p>

	<p>“To me, he’s the best point guard in the conference,” said Dore. </p>

	<p>“He’s having a really good year. He plays hard; he’s playing smarter.</p>

	<p>“As Adam goes, the team goes. He makes our guys that much better,” he continued.</p>

	<p>A Montreal native, Chmielewski played three seasons at Champlain College Saint-Lambert before heading to St. Francis College in Brooklyn for a season, taking on the likes of Boston College, Davidson College and the University of South Florida in 2010-2011. Chmielewski averaged 2.2 points a game and 12.7 minutes a game as a reserve in his one year at St. Francis. </p>

	<p>“The competition was tough and highly physical,” said Chmielewski.</p>

	<p>“It definitely helped to play in the States in terms of playing with high intensity.”</p>

	<p>While Chmielewski added that he enjoyed the numerous trips, including playing at Madison Square Garden, he says personal reasons, notably his studies, were what brought him back to Montreal. </p>

	<p>“I wasn’t sure what I was studying [at St. Francis],” Chmielewski said. </p>

	<p>“I really went there for basketball. I found what I needed to study [at Concordia].”</p>

	<p>Chmielewski took up a degree in economics at Concordia and joined the basketball team in 2012, where he came across a former rival and Champlain College teammate in now fifth-year guard Jean-André Moussignac. </p>

	<p>The two had played against each other for years before becoming teammates at Champlain, where they both competed for starting spots at guard. </p>

	<p>“I always liked playing against him, it was kind of hard to not be able to compete against him,” said Moussignac. </p>

	<p>Playing with and against Chmielewski for as long as he has, Moussignac has gotten a feel for what type of player Chmielewski is on the court. </p>

	<p>“He’s a competitor,” Moussignac said. </p>

	<p>“He tries to do the right thing and tries to compete all the time, but sometimes he just worries so much about everything that he takes himself out of the game. </p>

	<p>“All in all, he’s a good basketball player,” Moussignac continued.</p>

	<p>“He just has to stay focused and not overreact.” </p>

	<p>Off the court, Chmielewski’s seriousness transcends the hardwood and spills into his studies, but it doesn’t take away from his everyday personality.</p>

	<p>“He’s a serious student,” said Dore. </p>

	<p>“[But] he’s a good guy off the court; no problems, well-[maintained]. He’s a pleasure to be around.”</p>

	<p>“It’s kind of hard to separate ‘Basketball Adam’ and ‘Life Adam’,” Moussignac said. </p>

	<p>“As we’re growing older, we have more passion for the game. It’s kind of hard to separate both of them.” </p>

	<p>Chmielewski will graduate this spring but hasn’t decided on whether he will return to the team for next season, as he still has two years of eligibility. With his degree, Chmielewski has expressed an interest in the field of economics and says he’d like to work in a bank. </p>

	<p>“I like economics because I’m good at it, in some ways, and it’s really interesting,” Chmielewski said.</p>

	<p>“I just like that economics influences everything in society, money, circulation and banks.” </p>

			<p><i>British Indie Outfit Lanterns On the Lake Bring Warm Vibes to Montreal</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/Fringe/19fr.LanternsontheLake_690_449_90.jpg" alt="" />
			<p>Lanterns on the Lake will be embarking on their first North American tour hot off the heels of the release of their second full-length &#8220;Until the Colours Run.&#8221; </p>
			
			
			<p>A creaky wooden hall in the middle of nowhere with the bitter cold creeping in through every crack sounds better suited for the setting of a horror movie than a place to make a record. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>For British five-piece indie post-rock group Lanterns on the Lake, spending a month recording their second full-length album <em>Until the Colours Run</em> in such a hall in the snowy woods of Newcastle two years ago indeed made for a harrowing experience—but it was also a unifying one.</p>

	<p>“We hired this big old school hall in the countryside—in the winter, which was freezing—and played the music as live together as we could and recorded it kind of like a live album,” said Hazel Wilde, the band’s leading vocalist.</p>

	<p>“It feels like all the songs fit together and sound like they’re from the same time and place, whereas on the first record, the songs came together over a number of years.”</p>

	<p>Wilde explained that for their first record, <em>Gracious Tide, Take Me Home</em>, the band recorded all their own instruments separately and stitched together each song like Frankenstein’s indie monster.</p>

	<p>“The first record that we made, it was done in quite a fragmented way. One or two of us would come up with song ideas and record it at home, and different people would record different parts, in our houses, really,” Wilde said.</p>

	<p>“It was all done outside of work and day jobs and in the evening, trying to fit it all in. It took quite a long time.”</p>

	<p>But the band was determined to remedy that for their second record—even if their congregation place was out in the boonies in the dead of winter and they had to make up for the loss of vocalist and guitarist Adam and bassist Brendan Sykes, brothers who left the band in 2012.</p>

	<p>Joined by new bassist, Andrew Scrogham, the band’s unity on <em>Until the Colours Run</em> can easily be heard in the album’s atmospheric and graceful vibes, with the songs overflowing with warmth.</p>

	<p>Opening tracks “Elodie” and “The Buffalo Days” launch nostalgic post-rock guitar licks over a foundation of violins and piano to guide listeners home, while slower tracks like “The Ghost That Sleeps In Me” and “Green &amp; Gold” have a rustic, vintage veneer, with Wilde’s faint echoing vocals confessing haunting tales over folksy piano melodies.</p>

	<p>The old-timey aesthetic of <em>Until the Colours Run</em> was no accident—the band engineered the sentimental sound through a medley of creative techniques.</p>

	<p>“We try to sample a lot of natural sounds, Wilde said. “Some of the crackle you can hear is the fire that Sarah [the violinist] has in her house. We just recorded the sound of the fire crackling; it just kind of gives it that warmth we were after.</p>

	<p>“We ran it through a tape player and stuff like that,” she continued. “We just wanted it to feel warm and close and quite natural.”</p>

	<p>The group record all their music themselves—guitarist Paul Gregory takes the lead on production and the rest “chip in,” Wilde says.</p>

	<p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HriCw6aIk0U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

	<p><strong>We’re Not Gonna Take It</strong></p>

	<p>Although the sound is often sugary sweet, <em>Until the Colours Run</em> is not simply a flowery record about the beauty of the world. At its calloused core is a stabbing critique of the state of England.</p>

	<p>“This album was recorded at a time that was quite difficult for us. We had no money, and we were struggling a bit in terms of wondering what was going to be happening to the band and the future, and how long we could last,” Wilde said.</p>

	<p>“At the same time, where I live in the northeast of England there are a lot of problems with unemployment, and at the minute the politicians and the government in the U.K. are really not acting very morally in how they’re treating people in the country, especially in the north,” she continued. “A lot of that is fed into the lyrics.”</p>

	<p>When asked why she was interested in incorporating sociopolitical commentary into her music, Wilde replied with a question of her own—how could she <em>not</em>?</p>

	<p>“I’ve never sat down and said, ‘I’m gonna write a protest song,’” she said. “It’s just things that naturally feed into the music. It’s slightly a political record, but it’s not just that, it just reflects what’s going on at the time.</p>

	<p>“It naturally sinks into it,” she continued. “I can’t really see how people can’t be influenced by what’s going on around them. I find that more strange.”</p>

	<p><em>Until the Colours Run</em> was released in October of last year in the U.K. and on Jan. 14 in North America. The band is currently on tour, heading to North America after stops in such European cities as Berlin, Zurich, Paris, Milan and Amsterdam. </p>

			<p><i>Norwegian Scent Artist Sissel Tolaas to Tantalize Concordia with Hexagram Lecture</i></p>

			<p>For humans, our not-so-keen sense of smell is often overlooked in favour of the more popular senses—seeing a red-and-purple-splashed sunset, or hearing a complex, brilliant symphony. But for Norwegian scent artist and “professional in-betweener” Sissel Tolaas, our sense of smell is her bread and butter.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>This Thursday, the Hexagram-Concordia Centre for Research-Creation in Media Arts and Technology continues its Distinguished Speaker Series in collaboration with Conversations in Contemporary Art with a lecture by Tolaas. With experience in multiple fields, including chemistry, linguistics and visual art, Tolaas’s work lies somewhere between researcher, artist and consultant.</p>

	<p>“I’m not just an artist, I’m not just a scientist, I’m not just a facilitator, I’m beyond that,” she said. “People always ask you, what do you do, what do you call yourself, so I had to come up with something and that’s the word that I found the most proper for my position, for the way I think.”</p>

	<p>In addition to working on her own olfactory artistic projects, she has worked with companies such as Comme des Garçons and Chanel, and her research lab in Berlin is sponsored by International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, the world’s largest producer of fragrances.</p>

	<p>“She works with industry, she works in the art world, and then she does these interdisciplinary research projects,” said Chris Salter, director of Hexagram-Concordia and coordinator of the upcoming event.</p>

	<p>“I think that is very much in the spirit of Hexagram [and] interdisciplinary work in general. You’re moving between different work, different worlds, different people, different kinds of practices and it demands that you really have this openness.”</p>

	<p>Beginning with a lecture from Tolaas, the event will transition into a “Hexa_Out” session—a roundtable discussion between Tolaas and other artists and researchers whose work deals with the senses and animal perception. The panel will be moderated by David Howes, a Concordia professor of anthropology and director of the Concordia Sensoria Research Team, whose work deals with the senses in relation to culture.</p>

	<p>Salter described why it is difficult to discuss scent in an artistic or academic setting.</p>

	<p>“Smell is very interesting because we don’t have a strong language for it. We have all sorts of words for vision, but we don’t have a lot of words for smell,” he said.</p>

	<p>Scent, said Salter, is considered a lower sense in western society, along with touch and taste. Sight has been the predominant sense in the art world for a very long time, with manifestations like painting and sculpture, which are passive artworks. Scent, on the other hand, is active—it enters your body and you experience it as a part of the work, rather than stepping back and simply observing.</p>

	<p>Tolaas believes there is a lack of education surrounding the senses, especially smell.</p>

	<p>“I’m trying to put smell back on track and say, ‘Listen, we have amazing software in our bodies and it’s called our senses, and we primarily program and use one of them, which is seeing,’” said Tolaas. “I think there has to be a balance. There was always meant to be a balance between the senses.”</p>

	<p>Tolaas explained that by not teaching people to understand their sense of smell we are losing a part of our personal and cultural identity.</p>

	<p>“We all have a smell ID as unique as our fingerprint, but when do we find it out?” she asked.</p>

	<p>She also decried the sterilization, deodourization and perfuming of the world—that by removing or covering up natural scents we also remove important information from the world.</p>

	<p>“I’m not [saying], ‘We need dirty humans, we need dirty cities.’ That’s not what I’m saying. But there’s no need to camouflage everything,” she said.</p>

	<p>The first step towards training the underused sense is overcoming scent prejudices.</p>

	<p>“You know the first time you smell a smell is the essential moment,” said Tolaas. “If that moment is positive or negative emotionally, your relation to that smell is that for the rest of your life.”</p>

	<p>For Tolaas, scent is a medium like any other. Her research lab houses countless scents, from Moroccan rose to stinky socks, and synthetics, extracts and physical samples harvested from around the world.</p>

	<p>“I try to relate to smell intellectually or rationally rather than emotionally,” she said.</p>

	<p><em>Human Cheese</em>, an ongoing project of Tolaas’s in collaboration with biologist and artist Christina Agapakis, explores the notion of good and bad smells. In the latest installation of the project, a lab was set up where participants could donate various bacteria from their bodies that were then used to ferment actual cheese.</p>

	<p>If cheese has a strong odour it’s considered a positive thing, Tolaas explained, but the same isn’t true when it comes to the body. The project aims to showcase the importance of our bodies’ bacteria in a tangible way.</p>

	<p>“It’s more food for thought than food for eating,” she said.</p>

			<p><i>Worldwide Feminist Wikipedia Edit-a-thon to Take Over the Web This Weekend</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/Fringe/19fr.Wikipedia.Graeme_690_510_90.jpg" alt="" />
			<p>Feminists and allies will be occupying Wikipedia this weekend at worldwide &#8220;edit-a-thon.&#8221; Graphic Graeme Shorten Adams</p>
			
			
			<p>On Feb. 1, Wikipedia is getting a makeover—or is it a reality check? </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>At 22 locations across the globe, from Wisconsin to Australia, individuals across the net will tackle the lack of feminist content as well as the lapses in art pages on Wikipedia, and Montreal will be one of these hotspots of Internet activism.</p>

	<p>Eastern Bloc, an “exhibition and arts production centre dedicated to New Media,” along with Studio XX, <em>.dpi</em> and Skol will be hosting Montreal’s own Art + Feminism Edit-a-thon in solidarity with the other cities around the world also participating.</p>

	<p>The event will be a gathering of editors who will update Wikipedia’s current art and feminist content, which, according to its organizers, is seriously lacking.</p>

	<p>“You’ll have five pages of text on a <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> costume and then you won’t be able to find a famous artist’s page because it just isn’t there,” said Amber Berson, in charge of organizing Montreal’s Edit-a-thon, citing artist Adrian Piper as an example. Piper’s Wikipedia page was just recently built.</p>

	<p>The initiative brings to mind one by Guerrilla Girls, an anonymous group of female artists who work to “expose sexism and racism in politics, the art world, film and the culture at large,” and wear gorilla masks to disguise themselves.</p>

	<p>They formed in 1985 following the Museum of Modern Art’s 1984 exhibition “An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture,” which featured only 13 women of the 169 artists whose work was showcased.</p>

	<p>This time, the issue is online and will be handled across the globe—not from behind gorilla masks, but behind computer screens.</p>

	<p>“It’s definitely somewhat similar,” said Berson.</p>

	<p>The organizers have posted a list of female artists to either create pages for or add more content to.</p>

	<p>“It’s like a book report, but on art and it’s more about knowing where the sources are,” said Jacqueline Mabey, who shares the project as her brain child—conceived over dinner—with Siân Evans, Michael Mandiberg, Laurel Ptak, Richard Knipel and Dorothy Howard, who all work for various organizations and galleries in the United States and Canada that often combine art projects with feminism.</p>

	<p>The project’s Wikipedia meet-up page lists a roster of sources to refer to when editing, but participants are encouraged to reference books as well. Good sources and citations are crucial in preventing content from being taken down, according to Mabey, who says feminist content is sometimes flagged or removed on the site.</p>

	<p>“Absolutely anyone” can participate, but women are encouraged to be a part of the event as the Edit-a-thon not only takes on the shortage of female artists on the site, but is also a reaction to a 2010 study by Wikimedia that found that only 13 per cent of its editors—the people who create and correct the site’s self-regulated content, which is open for anyone to do—self-identify as female.</p>

	<p>Berson says the number of female editors may be higher, but they might not all be identifying as such for various reasons.</p>

	<p>“You have to come out with more of a strong voice when you self-identify as a woman, as an editor,” said Berson. “There’s a devaluation of the way women express themselves and their opinions.</p>

	<p>“I would also say that the more that women hear Wikipedia, tech, whatever is a ‘man’s world,’ the more alienated they feel from it,” she added.</p>

	<p>Aside from the gender gap in the tech world, another reason for the lack of self-identified female editors may be that “women have less leisure time,” often caught up in managing work and life at home, which may include children, Mabey said.</p>

	<p>The lack of women in the Internet and tech world is well known. From gaming to Twitter, from the companies’ <span class="caps">CEO</span>s to the clients, Silicon Valley has often been called a “boys’ club.” Indeed, women make up only about a quarter of the industry’s workforce, according to nonprofit feminist media organization <em>Bitch Media</em>.</p>

	<p>By addressing those issues concretely, the edit sprint encourages people to contribute to the online open encyclopedia they may only be used to consulting—something Berson herself said she was terrified of because of a coding class she took in university.</p>

	<p>To make the process easier, more experienced editors will be on the spot to give tutorials and tips along the way. As well, experienced editors will be paired with experts in art and feminism. Child-care and snacks will also be available for free at the event so women can “come, stay, edit and have fun,” said Mabey.</p>

			<p>After one of their most disappointing games of the season Friday night, losing 6-0 to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport no. 2 ranked Université de Montréal Carabins, the Concordia Stingers women’s hockey team took Saturday off and went into Sunday’s contest against their bitter cross-town rival, the no. 1-ranked McGill Martlets, hoping to play a more competitive game.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>And they did, leading or keeping the score tied for 57 minutes. But the team wound up dropping the decision by a 3-1 margin.</p>

	<p>“In the dressing room [after the game], it was a mix of, ‘We were so close,’ and ‘We almost tied the top team in the country,’” said Stingers goaltender Carolanne Lavoie-Pilon. “It did sting a bit.” </p>

	<p>Friday’s game saw costly turnovers by Stingers forwards, and a defence that couldn’t keep up with the Carabins’ speed. The women in blue and black dominated the <span class="caps">CEPSUM</span>, increasing their winning streak to six games.</p>

	<p>Lavoie-Pilon was on the hook for all six goals, despite making 26 saves in the loss.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I felt that Friday night we just had too many lapses,&#8221; said head coach Les Lawton. &#8220;Our forwards kept having breakdowns with way too much inconsistency all around.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Sunday afternoon at McConnell Arena had a great tempo to it, with the Martlets, currently riding a perfect season, and the Stingers battling back-and-forth through the first 19 minutes of the game. </p>

	<p>The Stingers almost got on the board midway through the period with a two-on-one led by sophomore Marie-Pier Cloutier and third-year Audrey Morand.</p>

	<p>A few minutes later, rookie forward Valerie Wade broke in alone on a breakaway but couldn’t beat Martlets goaltender Andrea Weckman.</p>

	<p>Late in the period, with the clock winding down, a face-off in the McGill end proved fruitful for the Stingers, with centre Alyssa Sherrard cleanly winning the draw and veteran Jaymee Shell wiring a wrist shot just inside the post, giving the Stingers a 1-0 lead.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sherrard won the draw perfectly and I&#8217;ve been working on that shot in practice for a while,&#8221; explained Shell. &#8220;I was more patient on the play than previously and saw the opening and just fired the puck there, it all started with a great faceoff win by Sherrard.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The lead was short-lived, however. Off the ensuing draw McGill poured on the pressure, and <span class="caps">CIS</span>-leading goal scorer Gabrielle Davidson wound up a shot that bounced off the crossbar and behind Lavoie-Pilon. The goal was Davidson’s 21st in only 15 games this season and tied the game up at 1-1. </p>

	<p>In the beginning of the second period, Stingers captain Erin Lally almost got a goal that sailed through the goal crease but couldn’t find the back of the net. </p>

	<p>Shell had a couple of great chances in the period, getting a couple of rushes after penalties had expired for the team’s only two shots of the period. Lally also had a chance, but her shot sailed over the net.</p>

	<p>Despite McGill racking up 20 shots in the period, the game remained 1-1 heading to the third.</p>

	<p>The Stingers had a great chance to re-take the lead late in the game when they had a 36-second two-player advantage, but they couldn’t come away with a goal.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate we didn&#8217;t capitalize on our five-on-three,&#8221; said Lawton. &#8220;It&#8217;s a heartbreaking loss, especially considering we were minutes away from stealing a point away from McGill.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Near the end of the final frame, a costly slashing call against Cloutier wound up being a decisive one. Seventeen seconds into the McGill powerplay, forward Adrienne Crampton wound up a shot from the point that found the back of the Stingers net, giving the Martlets their first lead of the day with 2:17 left to play.</p>

	<p>They added their insurance marker with only 17 seconds left, on another powerplay, to make it 3-1.  </p>

	<p>&#8220;I really feel like my confidence is there,&#8221; said Lavoie-Pilon, who made 40 saves on the day. &#8220;I just have to work really hard now at keeping it consistent until the end of the season.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Across town, the Carabins beat Carleton 5-3, allowing the Stingers to keep a two-point cushion for fourth-place over the fifth-place Ravens in the Reseau du sport étudiant du Québec conference, and with one game in hand.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very confident in our abilities to peak in February and go far in the playoff race,&#8221; said Shell. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a pretty great season so far, with a steep learning curve. It&#8217;s still fun to see how much as a team and as individuals we&#8217;ve evolved since September.</p>

	<p>“This has been an incredible journey so far and I&#8217;m excited to see where it takes us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Next up for the Stingers is a rematch against McGill Saturday at 2:30 p.m. and a game against the Ravens Sunday at 3:00 p.m. Both games will be played at Ed Meagher Arena.</p>

			<h3>Multi-million dollar renovations to the Hall Building H-110 ampitheatre have been halted for a week following a water pipe rupture in the building foyer, according to Concordia officials.</h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

“At this point they have stopped construction temporarily,” explained Concordia spokesperson Chris Mota.</p>

	<p>“There was water filtration into the construction area and so [the project managers] are meeting with the contractor tomorrow to check it out and see what—if anything—that means, if there’s any additional work to be done or what potentially might the delays be.”</p>

	<p>The amphitheatre has been closed since the start of the 2013-2014 academic year.</p>

	<p><a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4797">Speaking to <em>The Link</em> in October</a>, Concordia Associate Vice-President of Facilities Management Peter Bolla said the $4.25 million revamping of the university’s most-used lecture space would be completed by the end of January, to then be reopened sometime in the spring semester.</p>

	<p>However, Mota says at this time it is unknown whether the construction delays will push back the H-110’s reopening.</p>

	<p>“Will that add two or three weeks to the schedule? It might, maybe they can catch up, I don’t know,” she said, adding a better timeframe will be known following the meeting with the contractor.</p>

	<p>Project management for the ampitheatre renovation was awarded through publicly tendered contracts to global engineering firm <span class="caps">WSP</span> Group, formerly Genivar Inc.</p>

	<p>The Montreal-based company, which reported revenues of $1.25 billion in 2012, has <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4022">been performing project management for Concordia construction projects for over a decade</a>.</p>

	<p>As Genivar Inc., <span class="caps">WSP</span> Group was named for alleged wrongdoing in multiple testimonies given at the Charbonneau Commission, a public inquiry currently examining corruption and collusion in the awarding of public construction contracts.</p>

			<p><i>Student Co-operative Set to Replace Café in Hall Building</i></p>

			<h3>After over 15 years in the Hall Building, Java U is set to be replaced in the spring with a student food co-operative. </h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

The problem, management says, is that they still haven’t been told directly that decision is final, and are still expected to pay $20,000 for renovations to the bathrooms Java U shares with Reggie’s bar.</p>

	<p>The café has leased the space from CUSAcorp—the for-profit arm of the Concordia Student Union—since 1998, but will be replaced by a student-run co-op after undergraduates voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal in a November referendum.</p>

	<p>“[CUSAcorp said last November] they would probably not renew the lease after May,” Java U franchise manager Jace Li said. “But it was us that asked [CUSAcorp] for the update because they had not told us anything.”</p>

	<p>In fact, Li says she only heard <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp would be replacing the Java U with a student-run co-op after reading about it in <em>The Link</em> two weeks ago.</p>

	<p>But <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp President Scott Carr says it’s “unfair to say there is no dialogue” between <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp and Java U.</p>

	<p>In late August, <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp met with the location owners and Java U head office to let them know about the possibility the franchise’s lease would not be renewed.</p>

	<p>“The contract that we have is clear and we do not feel the need to be opening a dialogue with them on an ongoing basis about their current lease agreement,” said <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp chairperson James Tyler Vaccaro. </p>

	<p>“We both know the obligations of both parties for it and we know the end date for it.” </p>

	<p><span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp was bound by <span class="caps">CSU</span> council in a vote on Jan. 8 not to renew Java U’s lease, cementing the mandate established by the November referendum requiring <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp to help establish a student-run lessee in the space. </p>

	<p>A financial needs assessment is being completed by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp to evaluate the viability of installing different kinds of student-run co-op business models in the space. The report will be presented to <span class="caps">CSU</span> council in February.</p>

	<p><strong>Taking up Space</strong></p>

	<p>Java U was founded by Asher Adler, a Concordia graduate, and Ron Mofford in 1996. Their flagship location—still open today—is at the corner of de Maisonneuve Blvd. W. and Guy St. Thirty locations are now open worldwide, including in Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, but the company’s very first expansion was into the Hall Building mezzanine.</p>

	<p>The current lease between Java U and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp sees the café pay about $7,500 per month in rent, according to Li. Carr—also the <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Finance—could not confirm how much the café pays in rent because that information may be confidential.</p>

	<p>A student-run initiative is expected to lease the space for free, but no business models have been approved so far. Services and financial feasibility reports from a <span class="caps">CSU</span> committee and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp respectively are being presented to <span class="caps">CSU</span> council in February.</p>

	<p>Requests for proposals for the space are due Feb. 24.</p>

	<p>According to Li, Java U is also responsible for paying for a quarter of the construction costs for any of the space shared between the café and the student-run bar Reggie’s, which is currently closed for renovations.</p>

	<p>Li says Java U was told they would be responsible for paying 25 per cent of the $80,000 total cost of renovating the shared bathrooms, which she says is unfair considering they’re being forced to vacate the space.</p>

	<p>Carr says the contract is quite clear on Java U’s financial responsibility for the bathroom space, adding that Java U is essentially paying for the damages incurred over their time in the mezzanine space.</p>

	<p>“If the construction occurs before they are removed, then yes, the contract allows us to charge them,” he said. </p>

	<p>“Because they’ve been around for so many years and they got the chance to use the bathrooms so much, you can throw it back and say the value of the bathroom has gone down over time because of so much use, and although they may not reap the benefits of a brand new bathroom they also reaped the benefits of a bathroom continuously being used.”</p>

	<p><strong>A Place of Our Own</strong></p>

	<p>Hayley-Jean Lochner is a final-year creative writing student at Concordia. She says she regularly buys coffee from the mezzanine Java U location primarily because of its proximity to her classes.</p>

	<p>“It’s out of convenience [I go there]; it’s at the bottom of the escalator and it’s certainly not cheaper than other coffee places around […]. As a space it’s also not particularly inviting,” she said.</p>

	<p>Geography graduate student William Zullo says he also frequents the campus café out of convenience, adding that the popularity of cafés around the downtown campus keep Java U from getting too busy or crowded.</p>

	<p>However, both Lochner and Zullo say they wouldn’t be against replacing the Java U with a student-run café.</p>

	<p>“It’d be very interesting to see if things change if a student co-op was put in there,” Lochner said.</p>

	<p>“It would make a big difference. If it was a student co-op I would go out of my way to go there,” she added—with one caveat: more affordable food.</p>

	<p>As for Li, who says prices are as low as they can be considering the amount they spend on their cuts of meat and chicken, she says a student-run café can be profitable only with good management.</p>

	<p>“I mean an actual manager, not a student doing the job. Students are busy with school and I know they need experience working as a manager but a manager is really important; they need to be in control,” she said. </p>

	<p>“Whether a business makes money or not comes down to the manager. They need to do a good job.” </p>

			<p>While the Concordia Student Union is no stranger to arguing among its members, last Wednesday’s special council meeting set a new standard for infighting for this year’s crop of executives and councillors.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The argument in question stemmed from a motion that would’ve seen an assessment of the CSU’s finances done to determine the funding available for a student-run food co-operative to replace the Java U café located on the Hall Building’s mezzanine. Problems arose when deciding who would oversee the project.</p>

	<p>An amendment to task <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Finance Scott Carr with overseeing the assessment was challenged by VP Sustainability Ben Prunty, who told council he wanted <span class="caps">CSU</span> General Manager Robert Henri in charge of the undertaking in order to quash any potential bias.</p>

	<p>“To be clear, the [motion without my amendment] could have easily been used as an excuse to exclude necessary interested parties from the legal deliberations, and very plausibly this would have been to the detriment of the democratic process,” Prunty told <em>The Link</em> in an email on Monday.</p>

	<p>According to Prunty, keeping things in the hands of the GM—who answers only to the <span class="caps">CSU</span> president—will limit any bias against a co-op initiative in the Java U space.</p>

	<p>The co-op initiative has faced its share of opposition and criticism since it began as a petition last semester. The results of an October referendum where students voted on whether to support the creation of a co-op—which passed overwhelmingly with about 80 per cent support—was challenged by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp, the CSU’s for-profit arm, which manages and leases the Java U space.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> Judicial Board voted in November that the results of referenda were binding and that <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp can be directed by the <span class="caps">CSU</span> towards a unilateral decision.<br />
Last week’s special council meeting saw the CSU’s referendum oversight committee present recommendations for establishing the food co-operative, prompting the motion for the financial needs assessment.</p>

	<p>Prunty objected to having Carr—also the president of CUSAcorp—in charge of the assessment, which multiple members of council called an “insult” to Carr.</p>

	<p>“It kinda makes sense to get the VP Finance to write a financial assessment,” wrote Carr over Twitter. “Not going to lie, but kinda insulting.”</p>

	<p><strong>Executive Conflict</strong></p>

	<p>Prunty maintains his amendment was only to ensure the <span class="caps">CSU</span> followed through on the mandate given to them by students.</p>

	<p>“As one of the only people at council to have sat through both of the <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp Board’s […] attempts to subvert the successful petition process despite the fact that it was 100 per cent in keeping with the CSU’s bylaws […] I am very aware of just how far biases can manifest themselves in legal matters when dealing with this question specifically,” said Prunty.</p>

 “I have been the informal primary contact point between the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and the petitioners and I’ve alerted the petitioners in the past, and will continue to alert them as well as the rest of the student body when the democratic process is not being respected as fully as it needs to be,” he continued. 

	<p>“Good governance is paramount to a functioning student union.” But Carr also has his share of criticism for Prunty.</p>

	<p>“I think the suggestions brought forward by Mr. Prunty were without foundation,” said Carr. </p>

	<p>“His arguments were unsubstantial but more importantly unprofessional. I’m here to do a job and I think that the uproar that we saw at council, who came to my defense, is a clear sign that they are satisfied with not only the quality of my work to date but the integrity,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“I just hope that Mr. Prunty will start acting like this is a professional institution.”</p>

	<p><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></p>

	<p>With its members divided and no end in sight to the volatile deliberations, the entire motion was tabled to the February general council meeting. <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp is also set to present its report on possible financial options for the student-run business.</p>

	<p>Beyond the creation of a financial needs assessment, the motion called for the union to adopt a “collaborative direct implementation” model to breathe life into the co-op. The model links the referendum oversight committee and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp along with interested parties in establishing a business plan for the co-operative.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> will also be consulting its lawyers to determine what money is available for funding the co-op.</p>

	<p>The union is looking to determine if they are able to use money from the student space fund, which holds millions of dollars the union has collected for the last decade to someday purchase a student centre. Undergraduates currently pay $1.50 per credit into the fund.</p>

	<p>Despite the conflict, <span class="caps">CSU</span> President Melissa Kate Wheeler says the union is set on fulfilling the mandate given to it by students to open the co-op.<br />
“Disagreements, especially over something this complex and important, are a natural part of decision-making,” she said.</p>

	<p>“We, as representatives of a larger body, are, and should continue to be focused on creating plans which are sustainable, cost-efficient and in keeping with the mandates we receive from our members,” she added. </p>

	<p>“Sometimes this results in conflict, but that isn’t the point. The point is that we’re moving it forward and fulfilling a mandate given to us directly by members of the <span class="caps">CSU</span>.”</p>

			<p>Programming languages make up the Matrix that is behind most new technologies.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>They are ubiquitous and yet we often have no idea they are there. Like any language, they are made up of a series of word combinations (often called tags) that produce the actual words, images and interactive websites on our screens. </p>

	<p>Also like any language, they are constantly being updated in order to be more productive and to support changing technologies.</p>

	<p>Unlike the languages we speak though, there are people and even companies like Google and Microsoft behind every language, supporting the cost of keeping them alive. Those not owned by large companies survive off donations and individuals willing to work for free, similar to Wikipedia. </p>

	<p>Here are some of the most popular coding languages today:</p>

	<p>1. <span class="caps">HTML</span> + <span class="caps">CSS</span> <br />
<span class="caps">HTML</span> (HyperText Markup Language) and <span class="caps">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) are presentation languages, meaning they determine the layout of a webpage. They’re almost always used together and are behind most websites. Plus, they’re the easiest to learn as their structure resembles English. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">HTML</span> was invented by none other than Tim Berners-Lee, co-developer of the World Wide Web, around 1990, when the Internet was making its first steps toward the mainstream. <span class="caps">HTML</span> is used mainly to determine structure and place data (text, tables, etc.). <span class="caps">CSS</span> was designed five or six years later, in 1996, to determine the alignment, text, background colour, font and other characteristics of content on a webpage. </p>

	<p>2. JavaScript<br />
JavaScript is another presentation language that is widely used. It was designed by Brendan Eich in 1995 and is supported by tech companies including Mozilla, creator of the Firefox browser. It’s largely influenced by C and Java languages (described below) and allows for interactive webpages much like the Pulitzer prize-winning Snowfall feature by The New York Times. It’s also used in video games now and even in new smartphones like the upcoming Firefox phone.</p>

	<p>3. <span class="caps">PHP</span><br />
Used for both web-programming and general-purpose programming, <span class="caps">PHP</span> was designed in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and is one of the most popular programming languages because it isn’t too specialized. Most web software, like Wordpress, are written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. And because most web hosts, like GoDaddy, also use <span class="caps">PHP</span>, employers usually look for coders who know it well. </p>

	<p>4. Java<br />
Created by James Gosling in 1995, Java is considered by many as the foundation of corporate computing. It’s a very general and enterprise-oriented language that typically isn’t used for web but is used for anything else, from Blu-Ray players to banking systems. It’s also used to program operating systems by the likes of Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>

	<p>5. C <br />
C is the grandfather of all high-level languages like Java, Javascript, C++ (a very updated version of C) and the near-obsolete Perl. When computers were first invented in the ‘50s and ‘60s, developers had to do everything by hand, including complicated calculations in order for their machines to have a purpose. C was the link between the machine and the programmer. High-level language abstracts lower-level machine code, rendering code more programmer-friendly. It’s powerful because it allows for the creation of fast application on all platforms and is also behind all operating systems and Adobe programs. </p>

	<p>6. Objective-C<br />
Objective-C is one of the early programming languages to resemble C. It was created in 1983 by Brad Cox and Tom Love. It is behind all iPhone applications. </p>

	<p>7. Python<br />
Python is another high-level language like Java and C, but is more readable and learnable. It’s often used in science research programs for it ease of use with mathematics libraries, as it can calculate very large numbers quickly. It was originally published in 1991 and is now invested in heavily by Google, so it’s bound to stick around for a while. Image-sharing applications and websites like Instagram and Pinterest use Python. </p>

	<p>8. Ruby<br />
Essentially the equivalent of Python—the two could be compared to Windows and Mac—Ruby was published in 1995 and was designed by Japanese developer Yukihiro Matsumoto. Its popularity stems from a framework called “Ruby on Rails” which facilitates the creation of websites coded in Ruby. These include include Shopify, Groupon and parts of Twitter, which eventually switched to Java. </p>

	<p>9. C#<br />
Another offshoot of grandpa C, C# (pronounced “C-sharp”) is a general-purpose programming language used to write Microsoft programs like Xbox and Windows. It was created in 2000 by Microsoft.</p>

			<p>The last university in Montreal to officially oppose Bill 60, Concordia will be the first to present its position at hearings in Quebec City on Thursday.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Concordia delegates will face the National Assembly at 2 p.m. to elaborate on a Dec. 17 statement that disagreed with key elements of the bill, also known as the Charter of Quebec Values. </p>

	<p>“Many thought we were very late to the party,” said Concordia President Alan Shepard at a university Senate meeting on Friday. “Turns out by the fact that we’re testifying next week—and this [consultation] goes on until March—that we were probably one of the first to submit.</p>

	<p>“Just like term papers or final exams, they all came in at the last minute.”</p>

	<p>The hearings on the bill began on Jan. 14 and are scheduled until Feb. 7. </p>

	<p>Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and VP Academic Affairs, and Roger Côté, VP Services, were chosen to present the university’s case. </p>

	<p>“This will be a stressful moment for them because the various political parties will be in the room. Everyone will try to score points off one another with us as the vehicle or medium by which that might take place,” Shepard said. “We don’t want to be taken advantage of by any political party in terms of how we present our ideas.”</p>

	<p>Although it supports elements of the bill, the Concordia administration criticized the proposed ban on visible religious symbols.</p>

	<p>“You can agree with the principles of a lay state, equality between men and women, but the ostentatious religious symbols ban is a real problem for us,” said Chris Mota, university spokesperson.</p>

	<p>The ban would affect more than 7,000 full- and part-time employees of the university, hindering research and student recruitment, according to an official statement by Concordia.</p>

	<p>“We need to have a community that’s really diverse—and we do and it’s a huge strength for us—and I would do everything that I can to protect that diversity and to celebrate it,” said Shepard in an <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4467">interview</a> with <em>The Link</em> last fall.</p>

	<p>Concordia also takes issue with the charter on other grounds, Mota said. </p>

	<p>“Universities are built on democratic thinking, freedom of thought and expression,” she said. “Having that kind of law governing universities would be infringing on their autonomy.”</p>

	<p>The university officially registered its disapproval after receiving over 200 emails from students, faculty, and staff. </p>

	<p>“This is a bill that people were passionate about on both sides. We wanted to hear from our community, and that takes time,” Mota added. </p>

	<p>The university’s position was endorsed by 11 associations and student groups, including Concordia’s full- and part-time faculty unions, the Graduate Students’ Association, and the Concordia Student Union—which first voiced its opposition to the charter in a unanimous council vote in September.</p>

	<p>Concordia’s hour-long presentation at the National Assembly on Thursday will be followed by a brief question-and-answer period. The entire debate will be webcast on the <a href="http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/video-audio/index.html">National Assembly website</a> and Radio-Canada.ca. </p>

			<p><i>What Can Esperanto Do For You?</i></p>

			<p>The world is home to about 6,500 spoken languages.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>But what if there was one spoken by everyone? </p>

	<p>This was the dream of 19th century Polish linguist Ludwik Lazarus Zamenhof. A native of Bialystok, Poland, Zamenhof’s hometown was equally home to Polish, Belarusian, Russian and German communities, prompting a language gap between residents. </p>

	<p>It is this language gap that spurred Zamenhof’s belief that a universal language could be the key to achieving world peace. In 1887 he took it upon himself to create one: Esperanto— which translates to “the one who hopes.”</p>

	<p>“Esperanto is what we call a constructed language, that many people learn as a hobby,” said Morgan Sonderegger, an assistant professor of linguistics at McGill University. “A constructed language is one that someone or a group of people made up all the rules and vocabulary for; [one] that didn’t arise as a natural language [such as] English or Mandarin.”</p>

	<p>The majority of Esperanto’s roots are Latin, though some vocabulary is taken from modern languages such as English, German, Polish, Russian and French. </p>

	<p>Since Esperanto’s first world congress organized in France in 1905, it has been recognized as an alternate international language by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p>

	<p>Today, statistics show that there are between 100,000 and 2 million active or fluent Esperanto speakers worldwide. The International Academy of Sciences in San Marino, Italy, has even made Esperanto its current language of instruction.</p>

	<p>“It all depends on the person’s capacities, but Esperanto is fairly easy to learn, even more for someone who speaks French or Spanish,” says Zdravka Metz, who co-founded the Société québécoise d’espéranto in 1982.</p>

	<p>“You can learn it in less than a month if you put effort into it.”</p>

	<p>If you already speak English, the most widely used language in the world, there may seem to be little point in learning Esperanto. Metz says that isn’t the case.</p>

	<p>“Here in North America, English and French are enough for you to make yourself understood, but if you travel in Europe, English isn’t enough,” says Metz, who grew up in Croatia, about 30 kilometres away from the Hungarian border.</p>

	<p>“If you’re a scientist, a mathematician or a computer engineer and you want to share information with your peers worldwide, you won’t translate your work in each main language; it’s way more useful to communicate in Esperanto,” she added.</p>

	<p>But could Esperanto actually replace English as the world’s universal language?</p>

	<p>“Maybe, I don’t know,” Metz admitted. “Because when you learn Esperanto, you won’t necessarily find a career [in the language].”</p>

	<p>For Metz, the role of Esperanto today isn’t so much achieving world peace, as its creator originally hoped it would, as much as simply facilitating international communication.  </p>

	<p>“I don’t think it’s essential for everyone to learn Esperanto, but it all depends on what you want to do in your life and how you want to use it to your own advantage,” said Metz. “If you like travelling once in a while, it can be useful to learn some of it, but if you want to work in the business world, for example, it might be useful for you to master it so can deal with people all over the world.”</p>

			<p><i>&#8216;Welcome Classes&#8217; Introduce Immigrant Children to French Language, Quebec Culture</i></p>

			<p>Picture a class of children each from a different corner of the globe. Some have been in the country for a few weeks, others several months. There may be two or three from one country or another but only one speaks Spanish, one Arabic, one Ewondo…</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Nevertheless, when they’re in class with their teacher, they’re not allowed to speak Spanish or Arabic or Ewondo. They are all expected to speak only French.</p>

	<p>This is Quebec, after all, and their class is a classe de francisation or classe d’accueil—translated as welcome class.<br />
At École des Cinq-Continents, an elementary school in Montreal’s Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood, Manon Dubreuil has taught welcome classes at various grade levels for 20 years.</p>

	<p>The goal, says Dubreuil, is to “make [students] functional orally so that they can integrate as soon as possible into a regular class.”</p>

 “Welcome classes are not just about learning a second language but about integrating into Quebec society,” she said. “For example, someone who is born in a country with completely different values, they aren’t necessarily used to speaking, to having the right to express themselves.”

	<p>Students can be admitted to the welcome class at any point in the school year, Dubreuil said. </p>

	<p>“Normally, they stay in the class for 10 months, and those who need it can stay another 10 months,” she added. </p>

	<p>Dubreuil, who also teaches and supervises student teachers at the Université du Québec à Montréal, said her biggest challenge is preventing students from speaking their mother tongues in class.</p>

	<p>Quebec’s Charter of the French Language—also known as Bill 101—was passed in 1977 and states that the province’s official language is French. The law requires that children be educated in French until the end of secondary school, whether in a public school or a government-subsidized private school.</p>

	<p>However, there are exceptions. One involves the granting of a Certificate of Eligibility, primarily to students with a Canadian citizen as a parent or a family member educated in English in Canada. Additionally, there are special and temporary authorizations available for students in extenuating circumstances.</p>

	<p>Also exempt from Bill 101 are those enrolled in non-subsidized—and generally more expensive—private schools, those who are homeschooled, as well as &#8220;Amerind&#8221; or Inuit students.</p>

	<p>But the majority of children and teens who arrive in Quebec as immigrants end up in French public schools. Most of them can already speak French and go straight into regular classes, although some benefit from a little extra help. Those who cannot are placed in classes like Dubreuil’s.</p>

	<p>In 2012, only about 38 per cent of immigrants arriving in Quebec did not already speak French, down from 49 percent in 2003, according to a recent article in <em>La Presse</em>. This number is expected to continue to fall as the provincial government implements measures favoring immigrants from French-speaking countries like France, Haiti, Algeria and Morocco.</p>

	<p>As a result, the number of students in welcome classes is also falling. In Montreal elementary schools, 3,856 students were enrolled in welcome classes in 2009-2010, compared to 3,258 in 2011-2012. This last figure represents about three per cent of all Montreal elementary school students. </p>

	<p>Some have argued that welcome classes do more harm than good, marginalizing new arrivals by labelling them language deficient and isolating them from their mainstream peers. </p>

	<p>“Well, that’s ridiculous,” said Dubreuil. “That’s completely crazy. They’re not deficient of anything, they’re learning a second language.</p>

	<p>“Try to imagine spending an entire day in a class in Chinese, with students speaking Chinese. Imagine how exhausted you would be at the end of the day,” she continued.</p>

	<p>Dubreuil added that welcome class teachers work with regular class teachers to try and help the new students integrate. </p>

	<p>“If a student in math, for example, is ready to integrate into a regular class, the regular teacher can accept to take them once or twice a week,” she said. </p>

	<p>“[Students] usually have fond memories of their welcome class.”</p>

	<p>Dan Grigore does. He arrived from Romania with his family at the age of 11. After joining the Grade 5 welcome class at his LaSalle elementary school, he started Grade 6 in the mainstream class in September.</p>

	<p>“It was a wonderful experience,” said Grigore, who had already learned a few words in French in Romania. “I think the teachers were very patient with us.”</p>

	<p>But what Grigore remembers best, aside from a class field trip to the cabane à sucre, is the friends he made in the welcome class and the support they provided.</p>

	<p>“Being with kids who are in a similar situation as you, going through the same experiences and learning together at the same level, it helps a lot while you’re being introduced to your new culture, to your new country,” he said. </p>

	<p>Grigore went on to learn English as a third language and completed a BA in commerce at Concordia in 2009. Looking back, he wonders how things would have been different  had he not had the welcome class.</p>

	<p>“I think if I had been thrown into the regular system without the [welcome class] or without other kids who had similar experiences, maybe I would have been more introverted, or had a lot of trouble making friends,” said Grigore.</p>

	<p>In terms of academics, he added, “I don’t know how I would have performed against the Québécois kids.”</p>

	<p>Not that the welcome classes are without problems. For example, like many teachers in mainstream classes, Dubreuil said that she is seeing more and more students with behavioural and psychological difficulties.</p>

	<p>But there are other issues unique to the welcome class.</p>

	<p>“For some time, there have been underprivileged students who don’t necessarily have services. The welcome class is considered the service,” said Dubreuil. “Some are under-educated in their mother tongues.”</p>

	<p>She suggested that the diversity of the students’ home environments also presents challenges in the classroom.</p>

	<p>“These are kids who live a completely different reality at home compared to their peers, because at home they keep their traditions, like their way of eating.</p>

	<p>“The other problem is parents who don’t speak French, so they don’t necessarily have help with their homework,” Dubreuil added.</p>

	<p>“But these are students who succeed pretty well anyway, in spite of the uphill battle they face.”</p>

	<p>On the plus side, her welcome classes are significantly smaller than the norm, with a maximum of 18 students. Also, she said that the students are generally more respectful, often coming from cultures that place more value in formal education.</p>

	<p>“The students get very attached to us,” said Dubreuil. “The welcome teachers have maybe a warmer approach. We have a special link with the children because they get attached to us and we’re their first link to the new society.</p>

	<p>“I know at a certain point [the provincial government was] talking about eliminating the welcome classes,” she continued. “I think that’s really not a good idea. The students should maybe get more services, but the system works relatively well.” </p>

					<p>With the job market’s consistently increasing competitiveness and fast pace, it feels like the further from the status quo our resumes are, the better our opportunities. </p>

	<p>Apart from significant Twitter mentions and your Klout score, something that’s often taken for granted—but is only growing in importance in employers’ eyes—is language.</p>

	<p>How many languages you speak, how fluently and even how you learned them may all be sweet spots for the professional you’re trying to woo across the table, says Mark Goldenberg, a former federal assistant deputy minister who now conducts research for the University of Ottawa. </p>

	<p>“[Language] especially stands out by what it says about the individual’s openness—openness to other cultures, to learning new things,” said Goldenberg, who led a study entitled “Two Languages: A World of Opportunities” in 2009. The study focused on bilingual education at the university level by the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages. </p>

	<p>“Workplaces aren’t the same, and it’s the end of your academic career, so if you don’t use it, you lose it,” added Goldenberg on the importance of acquiring or perfecting a second language at the university level.</p>

	<p>The study attempted to assess the level of second-language learning in universities across the country. Given that French is Quebec’s official language, but that it’s a minority in the country, both English and French universities in the province recognized the need for a strong understanding of the two languages, and therefore a need for such a study, Goldenberg said.</p>

	<p>But what Goldenberg’s team found were “serious gaps and unmet needs” in intensive second-language learning in universities across the country, which is the most effective way to see results when learning a second language, according to the study.</p>

	<p>Despite its uniqueness in Canada and its universities’ “increasing awareness of globalism,” Goldenberg found that second-language teaching was conducted much the same way as it was in the rest of Canada.</p>

	<p>The study published a series of findings and recommendations for universities in Canada to improve second-language learning. Among them were the fact that content-based learning in a second language—like taking a non-language based course in your second language—increases your chances of mastering it. </p>

	<p>It also recommended that Francophone universities establish exchange programs with Anglophone ones and vice versa.</p>

	<p>Two Montreal <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s are experimenting with just that—a program that, in many ways, resembles what the <span class="caps">OCOL</span> suggested universities do five years ago.</p>

	<p>Next-door neighbours Vanier College and <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> de Saint-Laurent are hosting students from across the lawn for over a third of their course load as part of an exchange program between the two colleges, aiming at improving students’ second-language skills.</p>

	<p>Although private Montreal <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s Marianopolis College and Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf started a similar exchange program a few years ago, Vanier and <span class="caps">CSL</span> are the first public <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s to go ahead with it, “signed by Quebec’s education minister [Marie Malavoy] and all,” said Loris Peternelli, the program’s coordinator and a professor at Vanier, referring to the process of approval by Quebec’s ministry of education. </p>

	<p>Though the collaboration between the two schools and its focus on content-based learning follow the very principles the <span class="caps">OCOL</span> highlighted in its study, the program is not based on the study, nor did it consult the Commissioner’s office, according to Peternelli.</p>

	<p>Apart from the two CEGEP’s proximity, the “great choice of universities and the doors it opens” were the main reasons for the initiative. </p>

	<p>In September 2013, 10 <span class="caps">CSL</span> and four Vanier students became the first to test out the new program. Each of them is taking four courses at the other school, including chemistry for those in science and western civilization for those in social science.</p>

	<p>The program had been in the works for a few years, but due to an extensive back-and-forth with the ministry of education, was only finalized just in time for the beginning of the school year, hence the small number of students enrolled.</p>

	<p>“It’s not for everyone, but a 30- to 40-student cohort is a good objective,” said Peternelli, adding that now one semester in, the students’ experience seems positive so far and that they had integrated very well with the other institution.</p>

	<p>The goal is for students to feel comfortable and be fluent in the other language by the time they get their diploma of college studies, said Peternelli. To complete their <span class="caps">DEC</span> with the exchange under their belt, students not only write the usual <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> exit exam in their main college’s language, but in the other as well.</p>

	<p>“We have quite a variety of levels—most of the students have a strong mastery of French while the English varies, but, like they say, if you want to get something done, ask a busy person,” added Peternelli, explaining that students needed an above-80 average to participate in the program.</p>

	<p>Peternelli says he gets to meet with the students every once in a while to see how they’re progressing within the program’s framework and how they’re integrating at the opposite school. Last time he met with them was before their one-month winter break between semesters.</p>

	<p>“So far, it’s really positive and they’re integrating really well,” he said. “I don’t know how walking across the way is going to go in the winter, but that may be the only drag.”</p>

			<p><i>Quebec Must Let Go Of Its &#8216;Us vs. Them&#8217; Mentality</i></p>

			<p>As I sat in my Intro to Psychology class last semester, I heard the professor say the words that best described my frustration with living in Quebec.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The words were “us vs. them.” It’s a mentality described in Henri Tajfel and John Turner’s highly influential Social Identity Theory.</p>

	<p>This theory proposes that people belong to certain social groups and have a sense of who they are based on their group memberships. These groups have sets of social rules that members will follow to be considered “us,” or to fit in. </p>

	<p>I was born and raised in Montreal. My parents immigrated to Canada from Italy in the ‘50s. Starting over in a new country had its challenges. From the many stories I’ve heard, Italian immigrants were considered “them” for a long time. They were treated like the unwanted.</p>

 I can see why they created their own tight-knit community, protecting what was known and loved back home while fiercely securing its imaginary boundaries with social rules. 

	<p>They formed their own version of “us” and anyone on the outside of it was excluded, while those on the inside were conditioned to stay well within its limits. It was only once I ventured beyond the community’s circle of influence that I saw a much more open and diverse world. </p>

	<p>It made me curious, but it was a while before I was courageous enough to break out of my community’s hold. I never did well in a box that limited me to someone else’s idea of what’s best, right or good. I needed to figure that out for myself.</p>

	<p>Living in Quebec at large feels a lot like my childhood experience. Although I understand that Quebec has a rich history and every reason to want to hold on to their language and heritage, the approach used for doing so divides us as a population and limits us.</p>

	<p>Quebec pours energy, tax dollars and resources into ensuring we are served in French, educated in French, and advertised to in French. </p>

	<p>Meanwhile, there are pools of unused potential in Quebecers that are stuck in frustrated stagnation because of the state of affairs. </p>

	<p>I’ve seen it in the cab driver who told me his story of being a medical doctor in his homeland but having to drive a cab here instead. </p>

	<p>I’ve seen it in the nurse who has an incredible manner to help humans but his Martinique passport does not open any doors, forcing him to return to his native soil. </p>

	<p>I’ve seen it in the autistic young adult who is a genius with animation and video games but will no longer have services to help him put this talent to good use once he’s 21 with a mental age of 14. </p>

	<p>He’ll most likely end up on welfare, playing video games in his basement. These people are all French-speaking and able and willing to work hard. Is protecting the language truly ensuring a healthy and thriving Quebec? </p>

	<p>Language is no longer what humans need to be protecting. What needs protecting, more than anything, is the quality of human life and the mining and realizing of human potential. </p>

	<p>The old-school Italian community created an environment that lacked openness and failed to evolve in a new world, and Quebec has done the same thing. </p>

	<p>In its need to conserve a language and status, Quebec has failed to acknowledge that the world is opening up and is offering ample possibilities for those willing to embrace change. It’s hanging on tightly to what used to be at the cost of great opportunities in what could be. </p>

	<p>I guess you can say I’m a dreamer. I believe in bringing down the barriers that divide. My social identity is that I’m human. Everything else is up for grabs. I am a proud Quebecer and a proud member of the Italo-Canadian community. </p>

	<p>I see much beauty and richness in both, but it’s their limiting and dividing rules that I no longer choose to abide by. I am fluently trilingual, but more importantly, I understand and speak the languages of collaboration, acceptance, unity and human interaction. What else do I need? </p>

	<p>It’s time to let go of this province’s “us vs. them” mentality and create a new reality to show the world what we’re really about.</p>

			<p>For many Concordia students, this year marks their first time living in a big city.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Having to adapt to the various cultures found in and around Montreal can also be challenging. But what if Concordia was also the first time you were learning in a new language altogether?</p>

	<p>For three members of Concordia’s women’s hockey team, defenders Marie-Joëlle Allard and Caroll-Ann Gagné, and forward Anne-Julie Deschênes, coming to Concordia was a huge transition­—not only in the classroom, but also on the ice.</p>

	<p>“For me, the transition from French to English was especially hard because I never studied or spoke much English,” said Gagné, who was born and raised in Fermont, Quebec near the Labrador border. “I do think that the transition has been a process. I succeeded my first semester in English, and I know that I still have lots to learn but I also know that I still have months and years to learn.”</p>

	<p>Gagné’s usual defensive counterpart, Allard, was in a different boat regarding her transition. </p>

	<p>“It’s coming along really well,” said the Victoriaville native. “I actually find that English is a lot easier to learn than French.”</p>

	<p>Deschenes, who played with Allard at <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> Limoilou, seems to side more with her former teammate than Gagné.</p>

	<p>“It’s going really well for me, I keep getting better,” said the Mont-Joli native. “I’m quite satisfied with my grades of last semester, and my teachers have been understanding.”</p>

	<p>At the rink, the fact that practices are held in English by coaches Les Lawton and Mike McGrath can make things difficult at times. </p>

	<p>Fortunately for the francophones on the team—who account for eight of the 22-player squad—two of their other coaches are French-speaking, Lise Marie-Breton and Dave Paré. </p>

	<p>Among their own ranks, the rookie trio say they’re fortunate to always have someone to turn to when they’re stuck thinking of a word or an expression.  </p>

 “From the very beginning the girls have been very supportive and helpful,” said Gagné. “They’ll help explain what the coaches are saying, and even sometimes the coaches will try to speak to us in French too.”

	<p>“They know what we’re going through and really go out of their way to help us,” added Allard. “They want to be there for support, not to laugh at us. And playing with my best friend [Marie-Pier] Cloutier is really a dream. She helps me on and off the ice.”</p>

	<p>It also helps to have family, friends and love ones to turn to during the transition for a helping hand. </p>

 “My father went through the same struggles and process when he went to study in the United States so he helps me out a lot,” said Deschênes. “My boyfriend also studied <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> in English so he knows my situation well.”

	<p>It nonetheless begs the question: why attend Concordia University, not only an Anglophone university but one far from the likes of Victoriaville and Fermont, in the first place? </p>

	<p>The players’ answers all had their personal touches, with one major thing in common.</p>

	<p>“It was definitely because they had the program I wanted to become an athletic therapist,” said Allard, who’s studying exercise science. </p>

	<p>“It’s the only university that offers the program so it wasn’t a difficult choice. It also didn’t hurt that when I was playing in <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>, Les approached me with the concept of a rebuild in women’s hockey,” she continued. </p>

	<p>“And maybe it’ll sound cliché, but learning English was also an interest of mine.”</p>

	<p>Concordia also offered the program Deschênes wanted to join.</p>

	<p>“I decided to come to Concordia because I really wanted to continue playing hockey while getting my degree. Being in administration, I know that it’ll be very useful, especially considering the John Molson School of Business is a great school,” said Deschênes, who then echoed Allard’s comment. “I also decided to come here because I wanted to learn English.”</p>

	<p>Gagné’s explanation was similar. </p>

	<p>“I chose to come here definitely for their strong hockey program,” said the psychology major. “But I also did want to learn how to speak and write English because I know how important that’ll be later on in life.”</p>

			<p>Quebec’s culture must be preserved—but I don’t mean the one Pauline Marois has in mind when she says the same.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Since the days of the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, the Quebec government has worked tirelessly to ensure the vitality of the French language and Québécois—or pure laine—  culture in the province. And that’s certainly admirable.</p>

	<p>But the way the province has undertaken that task has been to repress its own minority linguistic and cultural communities.</p>

	<p>And that’s absolutely wrong. </p>

	<p>Bill 101 tells you what school you can attend. </p>

	<p>The Office Québécois de la langue française tells you “pasta” cannot be written on a menu and in what language you can and can’t address your colleagues at work.</p>

	<p>Today, with the Charter of Values, the government wants to tell you how to dress.</p>

	<p>This spring, if an election is indeed called and the Parti Québécois becomes a majority government, the party stated it will seek to re-introduce Bill 14, which would prohibit the province’s own native francophones from receiving an education in English not only through high school—as is the current case—but through <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> as well.</p>

	<p>And it’s all in an attempt to protect the French language and preserve the Québécois culture. </p>

	<p>And yet, French and the Québécoiscommunity aren’t on the verge of disappearing anytime soon in Quebec.  </p>

	<p>Nearly 95 per cent of Quebecers said they knew French in the 2011 Canadian census, and it’s the language most often spoken at home for 81 per cent of the province.</p>

	<p>Talk show Tout le monde en parle is the province’s most-watched TV program and over 83 per cent of the population is Catholic—a defining aspect of the province’s heritage, as Premier Marois has made clear with her campaign to keep the crucifix in the National Assembly despite her push for secularism in the province. </p>

	<p>Indeed, pure laine culture is firmly entrenched throughout the province. It’s not because of Bill 101—it’s simply due to the fact that, in the overwhelming majority of the province, most cities identify with one language and one culture. </p>

	<p>As demographer Marc Termote told Maclean’s in 2011, “You will [speak only] French in Chicoutimi.”   </p>

	<p>It’s a different story down in Montreal. </p>

	<p>Here, French isn’t the majority’s mother tongue. </p>

	<p>Neither is English, for that matter. Instead, over one-third of the city’s residents are visible minorities and over half are non-francophones. </p>

	<p>The allophones dominate in Montreal. </p>

	<p>Ironically, this is mostly the provincial government’s own doing. </p>

	<p>Rather than work to increase the birth rate once it fell below the replacement rate in the ‘70s, Quebec instead decided to make up for the disparity by admitting more immigrants to the province, over 90 per cent of whom naturally settle in its biggest city. </p>

	<p>Couple this surge of new immigrants with a consistently growing number of francophone Montrealers moving to greener pastures in the suburbs in recent years, and the result is a declining pure laine community in the city—to the point that it may eventually disappear entirely. </p>

	<p>Quebec’s answer to all of this hasn’t been to try and reverse the trend. </p>

	<p>Instead, it has focused primarily on establishing the supremacy of the French language and the pure laine culture under the umbrella of interculturalism. </p>

	<p>Rather than seeing all cultures as equals under multiculturalism—a policy the rest of Canada has adopted—Quebec has instead imposed upon immigrants to the province and its centuries-old anglophone communities “a public culture […] patterned after [francophones’] own needs, their own priorities and, most of all, their own particular sense of identity,” as Concordia political science professor Daniel Salée wrote in his academic article “Quebec Sovereignty and the Challenge of Linguistic and Ethnocultural Minorities: Identity, Difference and the Politics of Ressentiment.” </p>

	<p>No wonder so many immigrants to Quebec and the province’s native Anglophones are high-tailing it westward by the busload. </p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the Quebec government has yet to realize that a culture isn’t preserved by imposing on people to adopt it, and that a province doesn’t become unified by dictating what language its residents can speak or by having them choose between their religious beliefs or their job. </p>

	<p>The Quebec government has yet to realize that “Quebec’s culture” doesn’t mean solely pure laine culture. </p>

	<p>Quebec’s culture has become a genuine mosaic, and repressing some components of that mosaic in favor of others is not the answer to keeping French from declining in Montreal.</p>

	<p>What the government’s policies have accomplished instead is to increase ethnic tensions, shrink Montreal’s linguistic communities and limit the province’s own francophones’ opportunities to expand their eligibility in an English-dominated global job market. </p>

	<p>The surge in Islamophobia since the Charter of Values was announced, the all-time low enrolments in English schools this year and the fact that more and more allophones and francophones are attending anglophone <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s in hopes of improving their English reveals as much.  </p>

	<p>It is time our government comes to terms with the fact that Quebec is multicultural, and that this is something to be celebrated; that it is an asset, not a threat.   </p>

	<p>It is time our premier realized that allophones, like Anglophones, have just as much right to their language and culture being preserved as that of her own.</p>

			<p>Quebecers agree on a lot of things—language isn’t one of them.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>In the past year alone, Quebec has made headlines not only across the nation but also internationally with such controversial affairs as Pastagate and Bill 60. </p>

	<p>But for Beryl Wajsman, these are more than just headlines in the newspaper. He says anglophones and allophones in Quebec are being discriminated against based on language.</p>

	<p>“If you’re a small business employing 15 people, and you put your money to work, many, many small businesses are owned by immigrants and if they can’t be communicated with in [English], based on their needs, they’re just going to close the door,” said Wajsman, editor at <em>The Suburban</em> and publisher of <em>The Métropolitain</em>, in reference to the government’s recent decision to go ahead with a policy introduced in 2011 to only interact with businesses in French.</p>

	<p>Wajsman is not alone. He’s part of what Richard Yufe, spokesperson for a group dubbed Canadian Rights in Quebec, called “a movement for language equality in Quebec” on Daybreak Montreal in May 2012.</p>

	<p>The movement Yufe referred to is the resurgence of interest groups defending the place of the English language in the province.</p>

	<p>Along with the election of the Parti Québécois in September 2012, newsmakers like the Pastagate affair, Bill 60 and, more recently, Creolegate, have caused much ink to be spilled on the hot topic that is Quebec’s language dynamics. </p>

	<p>Think pieces of all sorts brought up the idea of the proverbial space taken up by the two languages spoken in the province.</p>

	<p>Though officially francophone, Quebec’s—and in particular Montreal’s—bilingualism is often seen as one of its strongest assets. Over 42 per cent of the province’s population speaks both English and French, according to the 2011 Canadian census.</p>

	<p>The idea of a language divide in Quebec is nothing new, but it doesn’t have the same momentum as in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, when approximately 130,000 of the province’s English-speakers left for fear of not being served in their language after Bill 101 passed in 1977.</p>

	<p>According to a recently released report from the Canadian Institute for Identities and Migration, 28,439 Quebecers moved away between January and September of 2013—the highest number for that time period in 13 years. </p>

	<p>According to Jack Jedwab, the institute’s vice-president, that number is still smaller than that of 40 years ago and may be more for economic reasons than language or politics as it was in the past. </p>

	<p>However, many in the media speculated that language tensions might have been, once again, one of the main reasons for the departure of so many Quebecers. </p>

	<p>An article titled “More Quebecers are leaving the province” and published on CJAD’s website Jan. 9—the day of the report’s release—linked the statistic to PQ’s rise to power as a minority government.</p>

	<p>The same day, <em>The Gazette</em> published an editorial in which it said it’s very likely the province’s “degraded political climate” is “accelerating the outflow” of Anglophones. </p>

	<p>Last May, Montreal journalist and pundit Dan Delmar penned an opinion piece for the <em>National Post</em> entitled “PQ power gives rise to ‘Angryphone’ lunacy.”</p>

	<p>“Angryphones” are “the most vigorous defenders of linguistic rights,” as Delmar defined the term in the article. And they’re back.</p>

	<p>But they aren’t the only ones outspoken on language rights. In December, the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste, along with over 100 Quebec figures, including former premier Bernard Landry, launched a campaign termed “Uni-e-s contre la francophobie.” The campaign aims at denouncing the alleged unfavourable portrayal of francophones and the province of Quebec in English media, dubbed “Quebec-bashing.”</p>

	<p>As a French-speaking territory located in a country that is predominantly English speaking, and neighbour to one of the most powerful English-speaking countries in the world, Quebec has fought hard to ensure the survival of its official language. The province fights even harder as globalization makes the use of the world’s strongest languages widespread, as French is not included in this category.</p>

	<p>Despite polarizing voices, others have tried to soothe. PQ Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and External Trade Jean-François Lisée is known for reaching out to the Anglo community numerous times, and spoke out against the Office Québécois de la langue française’s initial decision to slap a fine on the St. Laurent Blvd. restaurant Buonanotte for not translating words like “pasta” into French on its menu.</p>

	<p>Delmar says such controversies being blown out of proportion is mainly to blame for the province’s ongoing language issue. </p>

	<p>“If I write about Angryphones every day, if I write about Societe Saint-Jean-Baptiste every day, you get the impression that these two forces are a lot more influential than they really are. A lot of this crisis has been manufactured by the media,” said Delmar.</p>

	<p>“But day-to-day, I think we get along just fine.”</p>

	<p>As for Steve Faguy, copy editor at <em>The Gazette</em>, he says neither the media nor the government is to blame. </p>

	<p>“Ignorance is the real problem,” he wrote in his blog in December. “Ignorance about Quebec, about the French language, about English Canada, about history, about basic human decency and about the facts.”</p>

			<p>One year after forming a government in an election triggered by tuition protests, the Parti Québécois has launched a debate just as polarizing—if not more so.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The ongoing hearings on the PQ’s values charter show what op-eds on both sides have been claiming since its “leak” in September—that this whole debate is just thinly veiled Islamophobia. </p>

	<p>Considering the PQ formed their government riding the wave of the Maple Spring, we can’t help but feel used.</p>

	<p>The week before the September 2012 election, <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/back-issues/read/volume-33-issue-2" target="_blank">the words “A Deal With the Devil” appeared in block text on our cover</a>. It illustrated a debate we’d had in our meetings leading up to the election: Could a progressive or federalist vote for the PQ without selling out their own values? With the best chance of unseating the Liberals, was a vote for the PQ endangering religious minorities for a tuition freeze?<br />
A plan for a values charter was never hidden by the PQ; it was a clear part of their campaign platform. But what was less clear was how far it would go.</p>

	<p>We’re now in the midst of a public spectacle—250 hours of testimony that, in his opening remarks on the first day of the hearings, Minister Bernard Drainville stated would not change Bill 60’s proposed ban on religious symbols for public sector employees.</p>

	<p>With the latest poll numbers showing that the Marois government is in the best position for a majority since it took office, it now feels like we, as part of the 2012 student movement, were used by a politician wearing a red square when it suited her needs.</p>

	<p>As far as the Maple Spring is concerned, we essentially got what we wanted. Though there are still student groups advocating for free tuition, the 75 per cent increase over five years was cancelled. Instead we saw a less than three per cent increase this year, and tuition increases are now tied to the average household income.</p>

	<p>The special law putting restrictions on the right to demonstrate was also struck down. With both these moves announced the morning after her election, we couldn’t help but feel a sense of victory alongside Pauline, even if we hadn’t voted for her.</p>

	<p>But that sense of victory is long gone, replaced with the bitter truth that the leading party is not capable of seeing the world from outside its <em>pure laine</em> point of view.</p>

	<p>This charter—denounced by the Quebec Bar Association, unions, universities and the province’s own human rights commission—has brought Islamophobia’s ugly head to the forefront of political discourse. It’s allowed the rant of a man pick-pocketed in Morocco, and a woman being “scarred” by walking in a mosque to be part of the public record.</p>

	<p>While the Liberals flounder in trying to come up with their own populist decision, the PQ line hardens.</p>

	<p>As students demanding cancelled tuition hikes, we were catalysts to the PQ’s government, Marois quickly bottling the rage awakened by the strike. The government can argue the charter is meant to represent the secular nature of the state, but that doesn’t change the fact that the province’s religious majority will never be forced to choose between their job and their faith.</p>

	<p>This charter does nothing to protect the people that its supporters claim are subjugated—it just denies them a chance to work in the public sector. It normalizes the persecution of difference in the public sphere.</p>

	<p>This fear of difference is not exclusive to Quebec, but the government is both validating such thinking and giving it a platform. </p>

	<p>It’s why Quebec women’s centres are reporting an increase in verbal and physical attacks against Muslim women since the charter was first introduced in September. It brings Quebec closer to Europe than Canada—in that this country does not have openly anti-Islam political parties.</p>

	<p>That’s something that should be celebrated, but instead civil liberties are being attacked. And we just can’t shake the feeling that we’re in some way complicit.</p>

			<p>I would’ve started this article way earlier if not for the snooze button on my alarm clock.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>It kills me to think of everything I would’ve accomplished by now if I hadn’t slept in all those mornings. </p>

	<p>The possibilities are endless: I could’ve written an epic novel, received a star beside Marvin Gaye’s in the Hollywood Walk of Fame, started a polyamorous relationship with the Victoria’s Secret Angels, gotten six-pack abs—who knows? </p>

	<p>Few people nowadays know the history of the snooze button, or about its awesome power. It’s not commonly known, for example, that Ancient Rome fell to the Vandals after the Praetorian Guard added a snooze feature to their sundials.</p>

	<p>It wasn’t until 1939 that English archaeologist Blunderbuss Cucumbersnatch rediscovered the snooze button. The next year, MI5 sent him on a top-secret mission to Berlin with precise instructions to open a chain of watch stores and sabotage the Nazi war machine. </p>

	<p>The plan worked. </p>

	<p>The Luftwaffe prolonged their 15-minute catnaps and could no longer coordinate their blitzes; Operation Barbarossa was launched a month behind schedule; and Hitler stopped waking up in time to order from the “early bird” menu at his favourite diner—something historians say moved him to depression.</p>

			<p><i>Condo Ban Does Little to Stop Development</i></p>

			<p>Walk along the Lachine Canal, or through St-Henri and you’ll spot it. Amid the low-rise brick buildings, sign after sign advertising a new condominium development coming soon, directing you to the sales office a few blocks over. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The continuing pattern of development and gentrification, particularly in neighbourhoods like St-Henri or Griffintown, has long been a source of conflict between the different parties involved, and in a recent presentation by Concordia urban planning students in the year-long class Urban Laboratory, another area emerged as a significant site of gentrification and unsanctioned condo development.</p>

	<p>It was revealed that in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough, the proportion of rental units has decreased by nearly 20 per cent over the last 22 years—all as a result of condo conversions. The students also found that, on specific streets like St. Andre St., the change has been even more dramatic, shifting from 93 per cent in 1991 to a mere 35 per cent in 2013. </p>

	<p>Analysis from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation reveals that the number of unsold condominiums on the island will likely continue to increase, which would seem to suggest that the need for more condo developments isn’t even there in the first place.</p>

	<p>In theory, the drastic decreases in rentable units in areas like La Petite-Patrie should not exist, as Montreal has had a condo moratorium in place since 1975. That has done little to stop the semi-legal—and often outright illegal—condo conversion that happens across the city. The moratorium applies to the entire city though is not enforced, leading to the disturbing trend of unsanctioned condo development in numerous neighbourhoods.</p>

	<p>The moratorium was initially put in place with the intention of increasing the number of housing units available for purchase rather than rental, while simultaneously trying to maintain a solid base of units available for rental. </p>

	<p>While there are those who support the moratorium, the loopholes that allow for condos to be semi-legally or illegally developed increases the strain being placed on those who cannot, or choose not to, purchase their homes; people who cannot afford to own rather than rent, and people like us—students, who are vulnerable to rental rates and the availability of affordable housing.</p>

	<p>Two separate spheres must be taken into consideration with the moratorium as it stands now—home ownership and the availability of affordable housing available for rent. </p>

	<p>Petite-Patrie, along with places like Griffintown and St-Henri, is being entirely reshaped through gentrification that, coupled with the unregulated moratorium, threatens the socio-economic structures that exist in these areas. Historically places of lower income residents, new developments in these areas force some of the most vulnerable people in the city out as they become unable to afford to live there.</p>

	<p>The city has an inclusionary zoning policy. With such a policy, developers are required to ensure that a certain number of units in a construction project are reserved for affordable housing, but because the policy falls under provincial jurisdiction it becomes difficult to properly enforce.</p>

	<p>As a result, those who cannot afford the lofty condo price tag are left out in the cold.</p>

	<p>The zoning policy as it stands calls for 30 per cent of all new residential housing to be affordable, 15 per cent dedicated to social and community housing and another 15 per cent reserved for units that are either affordable to rent or own. In theory this would provide a significant number of units to those who need them. In reality, it isn’t the case. </p>

	<p>It isn’t hard to see why the inclusionary policy is important; in areas like Petite-Patrie, where a significant number of residents are unemployed or low income, and where many rent, rather than own, their homes, the existence—<i>and</i> enforcement—of such a policy is key to ensuring that residents have a place to hang their hats. </p>

	<p>Perhaps the most promising avenue to changing this would be to grant the city permission to take charge of enforcing the inclusionary policy. Given that the city arguably understands its demographics and its needs better than the provincial government, it’s puzzling as to why it doesn’t already have control over this policy.</p>

	<p>As is the case with many governmental problems, increased transparency and the availability of documents, like those explaining precisely what the moratorium entails, could go a long way in ensuring that tenants are not taken advantage of. If tenants aren’t even aware that such a policy exists, how can they know when they’re being exploited or treated unfairly? </p>

	<p>It’s imperative that the moratorium policy be modified to ensure that the loopholes are closed. There’s no point in maintaining a policy that does little to curb the displacement of residents, but the policy itself should not necessarily be scrapped.</p>

	<p>Instead, policy-makers should focus on closing loopholes like the one permitting building owners to convert rental units into undivided co-ownership spaces—where individuals own portions of the entire property—from which point the property can be converted into divided condominiums with only the approval of the Régie du logement.</p>

	<p>This makes it possible for property owners to convert rental property into something that equates to essentially the same thing as a condo with negligible efforts, indicating a serious flaw in the moratorium. </p>

	<p>The lack of regulation for conversion of rental spaces into these undivided co-ownership spaces represents a troubling disparity in the moratorium; property owners can use the loophole as a way of avoiding red tape, and the end result is the same: lower-income residents being forced out as the rent becomes too high. </p>

	<p>As part of his platform during the mayoral race, Denis Coderre said the city should buy abandoned land and buildings around the island to reserve them for the development of community housing, and that “Montreal must fight inadequate housing using all its powers.” </p>

	<p>It’s a promising start, and it’s time that Coderre acts on it in a meaningful way—something that starts with regaining control over the zoning policy and finding a way to better enforce this moratorium. <br />
After all, what good is a moratorium if the precise thing it’s supposed to quell instead flourishes?</p>

			<p><i>Stingers Rookie Blueliner Hopes to Help Lead Her Native Netherlands to the 2018 Winter Olympics  </i></p>

			<p>When the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi get started in just under two weeks, Emily Even will be cheering Canada on like the rest of her Stingers women’s hockey teammates.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>But when the Olympics end and the International Ice Hockey Federation World Championship gets underway next April, Even won’t only be cheering a different country on—she’ll be playing for a different one, too. </p>

	<p>A rookie defender for Les Lawton’s women’s hockey team, 19-year-old Netherlands-born Even will don her native country’s colours when she takes to the ice in the six-team <span class="caps">IIHF</span> Women’s World Championship Division 1 Group B tournament, to be held April 6 to April 12 in Latvia, for the chance to secure a spot in the 2018 Winter Olympics.  </p>

	<p>The other teams competing in the group are China, Kazakhstan, Hungary, North Korea, the Netherlands and host Latvia.</p>

	<p>Even, who was born in Leiden, a small town 20 minutes outside of Amsterdam, lived in the Netherlands until 2009, when she was 15. That summer, Even moved with her parents and three siblings to Canada. </p>

	<p>“My father wanted us to come to Montreal and experience Canada for its culture and language to give us the choice later on in life whether we wanted to live in Canada or Holland,” said Even. </p>

	<p>The transition wasn’t easy for Even, explaining that she was unhappy at first and had trouble adjusting to life in Canada. Even said it was only in Grade 10 at Westmount High School that she began forming close friendships. </p>

	<p>But it wasn’t until the following year, when she transferred to Lower Canada College in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, that Even finally adopted her new home as her own. </p>

	<p>“After coming to <span class="caps">LCC</span> for Grade 11, I realized that I loved it here [in Canada] and that I wanted to stay,” said Even.</p>

	<p>The last European-born hockey player for either one of Concordia’s two hockey teams was Cecilia Andersson.</p>

	<p>The Swedish-born goaltender suited up for the Stingers from 2003 to 2006, when she represented her native country in the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Even hopes she’ll get to do the same in 2018. </p>

	<p>“Right now, the Netherlands are 16th worldwide when it comes to world ranking in women’s hockey,” explained Even. </p>

	<p>“And the top seven [ranked] teams go to the Olympics; if we win [the tournament in April] we can move up in the rankings fast.”</p>

	<p>An appearance in the 2018 Olympics would be a first for Even (and her country), who began practicing for the Dutch national team at the tender age of 12 and officially joined the roster when she was 14 years old, playing her first game in a tournament held in France. </p>

	<p>“In Holland, there are only 15 real hockey clubs,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“But the players are all very dedicated to the game, they really want to be there—playing for my home country is still such a huge experience.”</p>

	<p>Even holds dual-citizenship from both the Netherlands and Canada, something she’s made the most of. Despite living on the western side of the Atlantic, she was still invited annually to represent her home country in international tournaments.</p>

	<p>In 2011, she was part of the Dutch team that went to Australia for that year’s <span class="caps">IIHF</span> World Championship and took home the gold medal against the host team. </p>

	<p>The following year she joined the team in England for the tournament’s 2012 edition, and last year, in France, helped lead the team to a silver-medal finish in the competition. </p>

	<p>Even has also played in exhibition tournaments in the Czech Republic and Germany, among other places.</p>

	<p><strong>Life in Montreal</strong></p>

	<p>After graduating high school from <span class="caps">LCC</span> in 2011, Even moved south of the border to play two seasons at a prep school in Millbrook, New York, where she held the title of team captain. </p>

	<p>Upon completing her studies there, she decided to return home to Montreal and enrolled in Concordia’s Leisure Science program.</p>

	<p>Concordia was a natural choice for Even. </p>

	<p>“It was very close to home and they had the program I wanted and a brand new rink,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“They also had a strong hockey program, so it was a win-win-win.”</p>

	<p>For Stingers veteran Jaymee Shell, Even is a welcome addition to the team. </p>

	<p>“She’s a good teammate and she brings a positive energy to the room and to our team,” said Shell. </p>

	<p>“She has a shot that other goalies should fear and I like her style of play.”</p>

	<p>Still just in her first year with the Stingers, Even has many high aspirations that she hopes to accomplish throughout her time sporting the Maroon and Gold.</p>

	<p>“It would be pretty cool to be named All-Canadian at least once,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“I’d like to be a good, solid and consistent defence. And obviously I’d like to complete my bachelor’s [degree] too.”</p>

	<p>Despite having settled in Montreal Even still holds onto her Dutch pride, and has scored in every world championship she’s played in while wearing the orange and blue colors of Holland, a trend she hopes to continue this coming April.</p>

	<p>“I really hope we can level up, and be able to compete at that level,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“I hope I can play a major role and help contribute to my team.”</p>

			<p><i>Ravens and Gaels Shut Out Stingers</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/Sports/18SP.MensHockey1(Ion_Etxebarria)_690_460_90.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			
			
			<p>Coming off a four-point weekend against Laurentian and Nipissing the week before, Stingers head coach Kevin Figsby and his team knew that this weekend would be a lot tougher, facing off two teams in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport top 10—the Carleton Ravens and the Queen’s Gaels</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>What the Stingers’ men’s hockey team didn’t expect was to get zeroes across the board through both matchups, getting blanked 6-0 Friday night against Carleton and 4-0 the following afternoon versus Queen’s.</p>

	<p>Friday night against the seventh-ranked Ravens saw the return of forward Taylor Lambke, who hadn’t played in a couple of months nursing a foot and shoulder injury.</p>

	<p>“It’s definitely an adjustment coming back, especially with two tough games,” said Lambke. </p>

	<p>“I think we worked harder, more so in the second half of Sunday’s game. It’s been a while [since we’ve] played all together, so it’s going to be nice the rest of the way forward.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers trailed by one after the first period with goaltender Antonio Mastropietro making nine saves. After a melee erupted at the buzzer, Raven Jordan Deagle was given a four-minute double minor for head-butting.</p>

	<p>The Ravens took this opportunity to seal their victory in the game—scoring two power play markers, along with a shorthanded goal to give Carleton the easy victory.</p>

	<p>In the third, and after the Ravens scored their fourth goal, Figsby gave Mastropietro the yank, and let Antoine Marchand get some ice time in nets. Marchand made some key saves, but unfortunately the offense couldn’t get anything started.</p>

	<p>With 3:38 left in the game Concordia forward Jessyco Bernard was awarded a penalty shot, but was denied by Francis Dupuis, who made 20 saves for the shutout.</p>

	<p>Saturday’s afternoon against the Gaels seemed to get off on the wrong skate right away, when off the opening Bernard was assessed a two and a 10-minute misconduct for a hit to the head just 22 seconds into the contest.</p>

	<p>Queens’ opened the score four minutes later when forward Corey Bureau slapped one past Mastropietro.</p>

	<p>The game continued back and forth until the Gaels’ Yannick Laflamme took an interference call at 11:01.</p>

	<p>That man advantage provided opportunity for the Stingers, but it was the Maroon and Gold who paid the ultimate price during their power play. The Gaels showed their dominance, scoring two quick shorthanded goals by Stephane Chabot and Pat McGillis to widen their lead to 3-0 just over 10 minutes into the contest.</p>

	<p>“It really wasn’t part of our game plan today,” said Figsby.</p>

	<p>“Our defence pinched twice, and they’re that good of a team [that] they were able to capitalize both times.”</p>

	<p><a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/5099">Stingers standout Olivier Hinse</a> had a close chance shorthanded but just couldn’t get enough wood to fire it past Gaels’ goaltender Chris Clarke, one of his 26 saves in the shutout.</p>

	<p>Hinse was also under the watchful eye of Tampa Bay Lightning scout Michel Boucher throughout the weekend.</p>

	<p>McGillis added his second of the game on the power play late in the frame, scoring with just under two to go on a swift wrist shot right under the crossbar.</p>

	<p>The rest of the game was actually a great one for the Stingers, who poured on the chances, including outshooting Queen’s 13-3 in the third, but just couldn’t beat the Gaels netminder, or complete the perfect pass to get them on the board.</p>

	<p>“We knew before this weekend we were going to face two top 10 teams, two veteran teams,” said Figsby following Sunday’s loss. </p>

	<p>“We were a little bit uncharacteristic today, especially in the first period. We just have to practice all week and be better next weekend.”</p>

	<p>Stingers’ next matchup is this Friday 7:00 p.m. on the road versus the Nipissing Lakers.  </p>

			<p><i>Global Game Jam Comes to Concordia</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/GlobalGameJam2013_Welcome-1_690_411.png" alt="" />
			<p>The Global Game Jam will take place worldwide this coming weekend. </p>
			
			
			<p>It’s a new year, and what better way to kick off 2014 than with a game jam of worldwide magnitude?</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>This Friday, Jan. 24 at 5:30 p.m., game designers will come together to create games in just 48 hours; a feat of strength to some, and just another weekend for others.</p>

	<p>The Global Game Jam is the largest of its kind in the world, spanning cities in 61 countries, including Montreal. </p>

	<p>Concordia University and École de technologie supérieure (<span class="caps">ETS</span>) are among several locations in the city preparing for this coming weekend’s madness. </p>

	<p>For those unfamiliar with the concept, a game jam is a gathering of writers, artists, programmers, and musicians, who can collaborate or fly solo in the creation of a game within a fixed period of time. </p>

	<p>Typically, there is a theme which participants must attempt to embrace. In September 2013, the Boob Jam took a critical look at the use of breasts in games and attempted to redefine them. October’s <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4912"><span class="caps">GAMER</span>ella</a> aimed to promote more women within the games industry. </p>

	<p>Participants can create just about any type of game they like, whether it is a video game, board game, or card game, so long as it meets the criteria of the jam. </p>

	<p>According to TAG’s game jam coordinator, Charlotte Fisher, Concordia has been booked full, nearly doubling last year’s turnout.</p>

	<p>“There&#8217;s a huge boom of interest this year,” she said, “Last year there were 40 people signed up; this year it’s 60 with 14 on the waiting list. [There’s been] an increase in interest [and] we&#8217;re going to try to work toward expansion for next year.”</p>

	<p>Similarly, <span class="caps">ETS</span> has also seen a successful turnout, with a staggering 150 people registered and counting. For those interested in game development, it’s the event of the season. </p>

	<p>“The word is finally spreading and it’s a good thing for developers to stretch their muscles. And it’s great for new people; they&#8217;re getting more confident and interested,” Fisher added.</p>

	<p>For most jams, the theme is available beforehand, allowing participants to think ahead before they hit the grindstone.</p>

	<p>The Global Game Jam is different. At 5:30 p.m., across all time zones, the theme will be released, with Hawaii being the last to find out. </p>

	<p>From there, participants will have 48 hours, stretching from Friday to Sunday to create a game, with the event officially ending at 3 p.m. </p>

	<p>The secret theme poses a unique challenge for participants, as it not only forces teamwork, but tests ingenuity under the pressure of a deadline. </p>

	<p>According to Samuel Simard, president of Conjure, ETS’s scientific student club, it is their largest event of the year. They’ve been preparing since November of last year. </p>

	<p>“You want to jump in and challenge yourself,” he said. “Doing a game jam opens you up beyond the educational environment. [It] allows you meet people from all over, [from] hobbyists to professionals and make contacts.” </p>

	<p>Conjure started back in 2009 and has since grown from 20 members to 80. </p>

	<p>Their interests range from programming to people interested in hardware development. They’ve forged partnerships within the <span class="caps">AAA</span> industry and gained sponsorship from <span class="caps">ETS</span>, Warner Bros., and Electronic Arts to name a few. </p>

	<p>Their club is open to anyone interested in game development and they actively promote creativity. For more information, you can check out their <a href="www.facebook.com/ConjureETS?fref=ts">Facebook page.</a></p>

	<p>For those unable to participate in the Global Game Jam, the <span class="caps">QUILTBAG</span> Jam, hosted by the Pixelles, a Montreal organization which promotes diversity in game-making, will take place on February 8. </p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">QUILTBAG</span> jam will encourage the creation of games featuring queer identities and experiences. Details on the jam can be found on <a href="pixelles.ca/blog/2014/01/quiltbag-jam">Pixelle’s website.</a></p>

	<p>Pixelles will also be providing a game workshop on February 1, encouraging everyone interested in game development (whether they know anything about making games or not) to come join in on the fun. </p>

	<p>Just like any other game jam, participants are reminded to bring equipment with them. </p>

	<p>For those working on the Global Game Jam at the Sir George Williams campus this Friday, space will be provided, along with internet access, and of course, food and drink. </p>

	<p>The event will be located on the 6th floor of the EV building, in room 6720. For more information about getting your game on, check out the details on <a href="tag.hexagram.ca/events/globalgamejam-2014">TAG’s website</a> or the <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org">Global Game Jam’s website.</a></p>

			<p>With the season edging closer and closer to the February 14 finale, the Concordia Stingers women’s hockey team had a big task ahead of them this weekend.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>First they had a rematch against Canadian Interuniversity Sport’s number 2-ranked team Université de Montreal Carabins at home Thursday evening, and on Sunday afternoon they paid a visit to the Carleton Ice House for a matchup against the host Ravens.</p>

	<p>Despite a valiant showing from every player up and down the Stingers roster, they were unable to equalize the game late against the Carabins and wound up dropping a 3-2 decision. </p>

	<p>Stingers’ goaltender Carolanne Lavoie-Pilon played a solid 60 minutes, turning aside 35 shots in the loss, and 61 of 66 shots on the weekend.</p>

	<p>“Even though we didn’t win the game Thursday, I still believe it gave us a lot of momentum heading into Sunday,” said Lavoie-Pilon. “It really was a show of character.”</p>

	<p>The goals were scored by rookie attacker Kerianne Schofield and sophomore forward Marie-Pier Cloutier. Cloutier, who scored a beauty after stripping the Carabin defender in the Stingers’ zone, broke out leading a three-on-one rush before wiring a sizzler off the post and behind Carabin netminder Élodie Rousseau-Sirois.</p>

	<p>The Stingers had pre-game confidence travelling to the nation’s capital on Sunday, as they had taken three of four from Carleton this season. The Ravens only have one victory this season, a win against Concordia back in the season opener on October 19. The Stingers prevailed this weekend yet again by a count of 3-2 in the shootouts, giving them four wins on the season.</p>

	<p>“I think it was a great bounce-back game from last weekend,” said Stingers head coach Les Lawton. </p>

	<p>“Everybody has been contributing, and we’re really happy with [the] overall team play.”</p>

	<p>The game didn’t quite start on the good skate for the Stingers. Raven forward Sadie Wegner opened the scoring two minutes into the contest when she outbattled a Stinger defence and went upstairs on goaltender Carolanne Lavoie-Pilon.</p>

	<p>A couple of minutes later the Stingers got back on even ground with a power play, when captain Erin Lally took a shot on Ravens’ goaltender Eri Kiribuchi to tie it up.</p>

	<p>Three minutes into the second period Lavoie-Pilon caught a bad break when Carleton rookie Rebecca Klimo got a squeaker to give the Ravens the lead 2-1.</p>

	<p>The Stingers went into the third trailing and knew they had to get a quick goal to keep the momentum on their side.</p>

	<p>Five minutes into the period they caught their break when, on yet another power play, forward Alyssa Sherrard dropped the puck to Jaymee Shell, who wired a wrist shot past Kiribuchi to even the game at two apiece.</p>

	<p>The game stayed solid for both teams with each getting scoring opportunities, including a few close calls on Lavoie-Pilon, who despite her 25 saves in the win tried her hand at puck handling and almost cost her team a couple of times.</p>

	<p>“We’re happy with where she [Lavoie-Pilon] is at now,” said Lawton.</p>

	<p>“Her puck handling skills gave us a few gray hairs behind the bench,” he added with a chuckle.</p>

	<p>In the dying seconds Cloutier almost broke out on her own, but the time had winded down.</p>

	<p>After overtime solved nothing, the game was to be decided in a five-round shootout.</p>

	<p>The first shooter for the Ravens, Wegner, broke in, but was quickly poke-checked by Lavoie-Pilon, once again playing gutsy.</p>

	<p>“I may have had some extra confidence to make some risky moves,” said Lavoie-Pilon.</p>

	<p>“I was really pleased with my performance as well as the team who played in front of me.”</p>

	<p>Shell countered with a beauty shot top shelf, sending cheers along the Stinger bench.</p>

	<p>After Klimo missed, Lally used a pretty deke to undress Kiribuchi and put them ahead by two.</p>

	<p>But the star of the shootout was Lavoie-Pilon, who stopped all four shots she faced in the shootout and help Concordia gain a two-point cushion in the Reseau de sports étudiants au Québec conference.</p>

	<p>“Our goal this weekend was to get ahead of Carleton and stare Ottawa down,” said Shell. “And that’s what we did.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers next game is this Friday night at the <span class="caps">CEPSUM</span> to take on the Carabins yet again. Puck drop is at 7 p.m. </p>

			<p><i>Cinema Politica Screens Docs About 2011 London Riots, First Nations and More</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/riotsreframed_640_960_90.jpg" alt="" />

			<p>For Oxford law graduate and impromptu filmmaker Fahim Alam, the last few years have been a hellish ride.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>A few days after the tragic death of English protester Mark Duggan at the hands of police in August 2011, Alam was walking to his grandmother’s place from work through his hometown of Hackney, England.</p>

	<p>Roaming the streets of Hackney wouldn’t be such a daring feat on an ordinary day, but during the harrowing weeks of the London riots, few areas in East London were genuinely safe, and Alam found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

	<p>Alam, along with thousands of others that week, ended up wrongfully thrown into prison after a skirmish with police, accused of hurling bricks at officers. Following his release, the young university graduate was then electronically monitored for six months, adhering to strict curfews while awaiting trial.</p>

	<p>Alam’s reaction to his unjustified imprisonment wasn’t to get angry, however—it was to get constructive. Without any prior film or media knowledge, he picked up a camera and began documenting the London riots on the streets.</p>

	<p>His documentary, <em>Voiceover: Riots Reframed</em>, is the result of his guerrilla tactics, trying to reclaim the viewpoint of the protesters from the mainstream media who made them out to be monsters.</p>

	<p>The feature-length film is being screened all over England and recently made its Canadian debut at Concordia University through non-profit organization Cinema Politica, which primarily screens independent political films.</p>

	<p>The documentary isn’t aimed at any particular audience.</p>

	<p>“The film is simpler than many other documentaries. Any age or social group could understand and gain knowledge from it,” Alam said, while pointing out the importance of history and context in these situations.</p>

	<p>“Tottenham’s riot history goes back to the mid-‘80s after the death of Cynthia Jarrett.”</p>

	<p>Jarrett was a 49-year-old African-Caribbean woman who died of a heart attack while police officers were searching her home for possible items her son may have stolen.</p>

	<p>The following day saw black youth take to the streets, condemning the police as being institutionally racist.</p>

	<p>For Alam, it seems little has changed over a quarter-century later.</p>

	<p>Anyone capable of sifting through the 168 pages of the recently updated “Ministry of Justice: Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System” can plainly see that there are major disparities between the number of arrests and convictions between members of the “white” and “ethnic” communities in the UK.</p>

	<p>Although the document states that “differences [between ethnic groups in the Criminal Justice System] should not be equated with discrimination,” it’s hard to set those suspicions aside in light of London’s history where racism is concerned.</p>

	<p>Alam was determined to showcase mainstream media’s bias through his own lenses.</p>

	<p>“Crime may happen on someone else’s doorstep, but no one gives it much consideration until it reaches the ‘High Streets.’ These days the public receives a very sanitized and segregated version of crime and war from the media,” he said.</p>

	<p>Alam explained how omissions could be just as important as what is being portrayed. But could this possibly change anytime soon?</p>

	<p>“New narratives need to emerge focusing on a new form of propaganda,” he said. “It may take years, but I’m building a new political history and getting through to more and more people.”</p>

	<p>In regards to charters like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada and the Charter of Values that Quebec is trying to introduce, Alam is hesitant in accepting such measures.</p>

	<p>“I believe discrimination will happen regardless of such charters, but what’s more important is to take a look at the colonial past of Quebec and Canada. History breeds these outcomes,” he said.</p>

			<p>What’s for dinner? If you’re walking the pizza- and poutine-paved streets of Montreal, there are endless answers to that question. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>There’s a café catering to every craving. There are establishments, old and new, looking to serve up supper, and competition is stiff.</p>

	<p><strong>From the Crust Up</strong></p>

	<p>So what does it take for a fledgling business to stay above ice water with lemon in a city saturated in resto-bars, patisseries and fine dining experiences? What factors decide whether a new establishment will survive to serve another day or be forced to throw in the apron and emblazon darkened windows with the dreaded red “For Sale” sign?</p>

	<p>“Get back to me in 10 years, and I’ll let you know,” said Brian Szubiak, head chef of <a href="http://www.ristorantetartufodoro.com/" target="_blank">Tartufo d’Oro</a>, an Italian restaurant he opened with his brother Kevin in November 2013.</p>

	<p>Tartufo d’Oro is located in the heart of Little Italy, where eateries with encyclopedia-length menus dish up standards like veal parmesan and fettuccini alfredo. It was something the Szubiak brothers decided to avoid when planning their menu.</p>

	<p>“The vision was [taking] something that we knew—Italian cuisine—and doing it in a way that we found fun and exciting, and that you don’t really find anywhere else,” said Brian.</p>

	<p>Besides the curious delights on their menu, which includes riffs on traditional fare such as ravioli stuffed with sweet potato and carrot, pesto sauce made of peppery arugula, and a Nutella and amaretto cookie gelato, the two entrepreneurs insisted that everything had to be done with a meticulous care from the crust up.</p>

	<p>“We make all our own pasta, we make our own focaccia,” said Kevin over the whirring clicks as Brian worked the pasta maker in the background, prepping for dinner service.</p>

	<p>“We make things that meet our ideology—things that we know, ravioli and pesto, and sort of [turn them] into something a little more creative. We don’t find it interesting to recycle the last 30 years,” he said.</p>

	<p>Changing the red sauce and pizza landscape of Little Italy is no easy task, but the brothers are hoping that what sets them apart is what will keep them as a fresh, successful and relevant institution for years to come. </p>

	<p><strong>Some Chess with that Espresso?</strong></p>

	<p>Another up-and-coming business looking to shake pretense is <a href="http://www.chimeragames.ca/" target="_blank">Café Chimera</a>, a board game store and café hybrid in N.D.G.</p>

	<p>Owner and operator Philip Campbell had already been running a game store when he and a business partner decided to move it to a larger location and get into the business of slinging java alongside the games, creating a warm atmosphere where people could come to play and socialize over quality coffee.</p>

	<p>Campbell’s own foray into the realm of coffee is recent. He didn’t even start drinking it until he discovered Third Wave coffee, a movement focused on high-quality beans and developing relationships between growers, roasters and buyers—the microbrewery movement of the caffeine world.</p>

	<p>“I didn’t actually really drink coffee until about two years ago,” he said. “I didn’t know there was good coffee.”</p>

	<p>Thus, one of the prime goals of Chimera is to break down the public’s preconceived notions about what constitutes a good cup of joe by keeping standards of quality high. In Third Wave coffee, it’s common practice to compare the subtle flavours or nuances in a roast, the way one might at a wine tasting. It’s a concept that often doesn’t translate to a large proportion of the public.</p>

	<p>“Originally the baristas would write the flavour notes of the coffee and people thought that meant flavoured coffee. They would write ‘rhubarb’ and people would be like, ‘Rhubarb-flavoured coffee? That sounds disgusting,’” said Campbell.</p>

	<p>Campbell’s philosophy on education may extend to the public, but it begins with his staff. Many of Café Chimera’s baristas were sent to courses to learn about how coffee is made.</p>

	<p>However, a high standard doesn’t necessarily mean high customer traffic. Café Chimera opened in September and has seen its share of struggles since then.</p>

	<p>“We’re still in the process of establishing ourselves,” said Campbell. “We went through a lot of trouble starting up here.</p>

	<p>“Certain spending got out of control,” he continued. “You have to pay people, but then [you] have no money to buy more inventory, and that was our issue early on.” </p>

	<p>Cutbacks on hours and staff are one solution to such a problem, but Campbell sees some of the standards implemented by Revenue Québec as a large contributor to the struggle of new, independent businesses.</p>

	<p>Specifically, he takes issue with the <span class="caps">SRM</span>, or Sales Recording Module, a device attached to cash registers in restaurants and cafés to ensure that restaurant owners do not take liberties when charging clients. It’s a noble goal with some drawbacks, including the large cost it can incur for struggling establishments who may not be able to afford it.</p>

	<p>“The boxes are $600 to $1,000 depending on if you get a new one or a used one. Then you have to pay someone to install it,” Campbell said.</p>

	<p>Such costs might only be the beginning when it comes to the <span class="caps">SRM</span>.</p>

	<p>“There’s people who bought an entirely new [point of sale] system, and then this law came into place and they had to throw [them] out, because they didn’t work with the <span class="caps">SRM</span>,” he said.</p>

	<p>These major costs are a hindrance to independent businesses struggling to survive, whereas they’re only pocket change to the large chain restaurants in Quebec. Strictly speaking, the law might keep business owners honest, but it could very well shut them down while big business thrives. </p>

	<p><strong>Standing the Heat</strong></p>

	<p>A challenge shared by both the Szubiak brothers and Campbell has been handling the red tape that comes with opening a new business.</p>

	<p>“[A challenge] has been finding out all the rules that you don’t really think about, like permits, what you can do in terms of building,” said Kevin. “You need contract workers on it, you can’t just start mucking around.”</p>

	<p>On the other end of the scale, Campbell believes some of the food safety laws need revising.</p>

	<p>“We have to contract out an industrial kitchen to do certain things […] because we don’t have three large sinks,” he said. “We have a sanitizer and everything, [while] some cafés are under a dépanneur licence [and] don’t have to adhere to certain food safety protocol.”</p>

	<p>Perhaps these are necessary evils, but they are also hurdles for busy owners navigating multiple roles. On top of handling administrative affairs, Kevin has been learning food preparation from his brother in order to help out in the kitchen, while Campbell multitasks between café and game store.</p>

	<p>Both Tartufo d’Oro and Café Chimera lean on a close-knit staff to create a warm, knowledgeable atmosphere they hope will be welcome and appealing to customers. They’re both thinking big while keeping it small for now.</p>

	<p>“[We] hire people that would mesh well with the rest of our family. So it’s been a very warm atmosphere thus far,” said Kevin.</p>

	<p>In the meantime, it seems that all either establishment can do is keep pushing forward with sights set on the future, while staying true to their visions.</p>

	<p>Brian cited three key things to focus on to increase their chance of success: “The quality of the food, the quality of the service and a clear direction or concept […] to present to the public.”</p>

	<p>In a few months, the brothers have plans to update Tartufo d’Oro’s menu, to keep themselves and customers interested.</p>

	<p>“Every few months we’re looking to find something new, something more,” said Kevin. “We’re looking to always do something that’s fresh and innovative.” </p>

	<p>One can only hope that the public has an appetite for such food for thought.</p>

			<p><i>New Art Exhibit &#8216;Hybrid Bodies&#8217; Examines the Psycho-Social Effects of Heart Transplantation</i></p>

			<p>A haunting image from Andrew Carnie&#8217;s installation titled &#8220;Seized Out of This World.&#8221; </p>
			
			
			<p>No organ in the human body is as coveted as the heart. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>In poetic terms, it is the primal source of our most profound emotions, and can be given to—or shattered by—the ones closest to us. In bio-medical terms, it breathes life into our veins with every faithful beat, and when it ceases to function, we cease to exist.</p>

	<p>But what happens when this highly significant cog of human machinery is passed from one to another in a surgical transplant? Will the recipient forever hear a tell-tale heart drumming in their chest?</p>

	<p>Interdisciplinary artist, Concordia studio arts professor and one of the founders of the Hexagram: Media Arts Institute, Ingrid Bachmann has aimed a philosophical arrow at the idea of the heart—and the emotional and psychological ramifications a transplant between humans can have.</p>

	<p>Bachmann is a participating artist and researcher for <em>Hybrid Bodies</em>, an exhibition linking art and medical science opening on Jan. 22 at the <span class="caps">PHI</span> Centre. She focused her contributing work on the emotional reactions of such a significant gift and the idea of shared boundaries that heart donation involves.</p>

	<p>She stressed how overwhelming the sense of gratitude is among heart transplant recipients, and in an individualistic society such as ours, this feeling of gratitude comes with a certain discomfort and uneasiness.</p>

	<p>“We are a culture that’s very uncomfortable with the notion of ‘gift,’ unlike the First Nations, who entrench giving and reciprocity as a fundamental element of their culture,” Bachmann said. </p>

	<p>“In many ways, the project is personal and individual but there is also a larger part of social and cultural elements on how we talk about death, ownership and gifts.”</p>

	<p>To illustrate her ideas, Bachmann chose to work with Concordia dance students Linnea Gwiazda and Maxine Segalowitz on a filmed performance. For her piece, several video sequences play simultaneously on four different screens, creating an effect of fluidity and movement. Bachmann said the medium of dance illustrates the abstract experience of an internal psychological struggle.</p>

	<p>“I really felt I needed to get out of my comfort zone,” she said. “When things are invisible, such as heart transplants, there is a real complexity about what is perceived and not perceived.<br />
“I wanted to do more abstract performance of language with the body.”</p>

	<p><strong>The Scientific Method</strong></p>

	<p>In 2010, seven doctors and researchers formed a research team known as the Process of Incorporating a Transplanted Heart, and published a pioneering essay called “What They Say Versus What We See: ‘Hidden’ Distress and Impaired Quality of Life in Heart Transplant Recipients” in the <em>Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation</em>.</p>

	<p>Feeling their message could be better received through a different medium, the team approached four international artists to give a voice to their patients’ emotional distress and uncertainties.</p>

	<p>The artists were Bachmann and Catherine Richards from Canada, and Andrew Carnie and Alexa Wright from the U.K. <em>Hybrid Bodies</em> is their collective effort together.</p>

	<p>From multi-channel video installations, to digital three-dimensional photography, sculptural pieces and sound works, <em>Hybrid Bodies</em> offers a wide range of different perspectives and approaches to the complex matter of heart transplants.</p>

	<p>After having studied the video footage of several interviews of patients that have undergone the operation, each artist interpreted and illustrated the issue in their own distinctive ways. To a certain extent, these interpretations reflect the different facets of the emotional coping process that many of them experience.</p>

	<p>Visual artist Richards concentrated her piece, “Charged Hearts,” on the notions of artifact, gratitude and gift giving. She does so through the transformation of the heart as an object, molded into different shapes and built with several materials, such as glass and metal.</p>

	<p>On a different level, Carnie’s work, “Seized Out of this World,” conveys the ideas of vulnerability and far-reaching self-consciousness that he perceived in the different testimonies. His video installation showcases nude human bodies interlocking and creating different organic, biological shapes, shifting as if fluid.</p>

	<p>“Some believe that they take on characteristics of someone else in a sort of vague way [after a heart transplant],” said Carnie. “Even if they’re not, the fact that they’re thinking about it is really important, so they become destabilized. They enter this flux, looking at themselves, thinking about themselves.</p>

	<p>“Them being naked reflects our vulnerability to the whole procedure—we just become something that they’re going to operate on, a clinical object,” he continued. “It had that resonance of that vulnerability.”</p>

	<p>Pushing the metaphor even further, Wright developed her piece, “Heartfelt” around the symbolic meaning of the heart. She merges cultural meanings around the exchange of hearts—love, relationships and emotions—with the literal exchange of hearts implied in the donation.</p>

	<p>Using sound effects, she juxtaposes interviews of people expressing the difficulties they experience with love and relationships with people expressing their emotions following a life-saving heart transplant.</p>

	<p>“Alexa links the symbolic aspect of the heart as the seed of love and its incredible weight in our culture with the physical effect of heartbreak and transplantation,” said Bachmann.</p>

	<p>The artists invite show-goers to draw their own conclusions after visiting the exhibit—you’ll likely find a newfound appreciation for that tireless muscle in your chest upon leaving.</p>

	<p>“We are not looking for facts neither claiming that our work is truth,” Bachmann said. “We only reveal big questions about life, death and identity.”</p>

			<p>Comebacks in sports can be physically and emotionally draining on not just athletes, but on their coaches, too. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>After the Stingers’ comeback against the Laval Rouge et Or on Saturday, no one looked more relieved than longtime head coach John Dore.</p>

	<p>During the post-game interview with Stinger point guard Adam Chmielewski and shooting guard Jean-Andre Moussignac, Dore couldn’t help but interrupt to express his gratitude to his players.</p>

	<p>“These guys are my heroes,” said Dore, much to the delight of the two players.</p>

	<p>Despite being behind for most of the game—by as many as 13 points in the third quarter—Concordia’s men’s basketball team pulled themselves together and kept their winning streak alive in a thrilling 62-57 victory over Laval on Saturday evening, sweeping their home-and-home series with a 73-63 final over the Rouge et Or on the road two nights prior. </p>

	<p>“It was a really gutsy win for us,” said Dore. “I thought we executed really well down the stretch, we did what we had to do to win the game.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers’ comeback began in the fourth quarter, down 55-47, when forward Michael Fosu scored as he was fouled. His free throw completed a three-point play, making him the catalyst of a 11-0 run.</p>

	<p>One of Dore’s “heroes” Chmielewski was a key player in the Stingers riposte, coming alive in the fourth quarter after a quiet first half. He finished the game with 12 points and eight rebounds, including a three-point shot that gave Concordia the lead. </p>

	<p>“I felt [our] team came out flat at the start, but we knew we were ready to play once we felt the sense that the game was slipping away,” said Chmielewski. </p>

	<p>After beginning the season 0-3, the Stingers have since won five games in a row, and have yet not lost in 2014. Moussignac, who scored 10 points and had five rebounds, says his team—filled with new personnel and players stepping into new roles—are finally starting to gel.</p>

	<p>“Over the break, we practiced a lot,” he said. “We had more time to focus on every little detail. And it [paid] off, as you can see. We’re doing much better.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers don’t have much time to enjoy their victory, as they’ll prepare for a significant rivalry matchup this Thursday versus the league-leading McGill Redmen. The game is at McGill, and tipoff is at 8 p.m. </p>

			<p>The Concordia Stingers women’s basketball team was fully aware that the Laval Rouge et Or were likely going to respond from a previous beat-down, 60-36, handed to them two days earlier in their own building. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>While the Stingers could not replicate another blowout over Laval, they still left the court with the same result as Thursday night—a win.</p>

	<p>The Stingers started off slow, but were still able to hold off Laval, winning 58-50 and sweeping a home and home series. Marilyse Roy-Viau led all players in points, scoring 18 and grabbing seven rebounds. Concordia have now won four of their last five league games.</p>

	<p>“We blew them out pretty bad [on Thursday] so we knew they were going to come hungry,” said point guard Ashley Clarke, who scored 10 points and grabbed six rebounds in Saturday’s contest.  </p>

	<p>The Stingers only scored eight points in the opening quarter. Fortunately for them, Laval only responded with seven. Soon after, both teams kept it close, with no lead by either team being bigger than five points until late in the fourth quarter, in contrast to last Thursday night’s encounter, where the Stingers ran away with the lead from the first basket.</p>

	<p>Overshadowing the win, however, was a bizarre incident near the end of the fourth quarter, where Stingers forward Serginha Estime emerged from a scramble with a Laval player with the ball, while the Laval player claimed Estime bit her, yelling to the referees. Estime was assessed a foul, but not a technical, yet was ejected with over 3 minutes to play in the fourth.</p>

	<p>When asked about it, Estime denied biting the player, while Stingers’ head coach Keith Pruden wasn’t aware it had happened. Pruden said he was “disappointed” that Estime got ejected, but wasn’t overly concerned about not having Estime on the floor, replacing her with Tina Mpondani.</p>

	<p>Pruden acknowledged his team’s errors, and knew that Laval would play to erase the embarrassment of Thursday night, yet credited his own team for getting the job done.</p>

	<p>“In the second half, we showed a great deal of composure,” Pruden said. “We showed a great deal of competitiveness and we found a way to win the game.</p>

	<p>“That’s the mark of a team that can win a championship. You find a way to win, even when you’re not playing well, and we did not play well.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers’ next challenge is a home and home series against their rival, and league-leading McGill Martlets, starting next Thursday at home, before playing at McGill on Saturday.</p>

			<p><i>Concordia Undergrads Find Rental Housing  Decreasing in La Petite-Patrie Due to Condo Conversions</i></p>

			<p>“Gentrification” has become a buzzword in working-class-turned-hip neighbourhoods across Montreal, from St-Henri to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Some equate gentrification with the renewal of run-down inner-city areas, while others fear that it transforms poorer neighbourhoods beyond recognition, thereby alienating longtime residents and leading to their displacement as rents and property values skyrocket.</p>

	<p>It’s no surprise, then, that gentrification polarizes opinion. In Montreal, the tensions between “gentrifiers” and “gentrified” have sometimes gotten heated, with spray-painted anti-capitalist slogans finding their way onto billboards advertising new condo developments and on businesses’ displays. </p>

	<p>Occasionally, reactions to gentrification have been even more extreme. Last November, vandals in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve smashed the windows of four upscale restaurants in the neighbourhood. In 2004, another anti-gentrification group planted six packages disguised as bombs at condo construction sites in the city’s East End.</p>

	<p>Last week, 25 Concordia undergraduates and their professor waded into the turbid gentrification debate. They put in roughly 2,000 hours of research last semester to determine how gentrification is affecting the little neighbourhood of La Petite-Patrie. They unveiled their findings at a press conference last Thursday.</p>

	<p>A moratorium on condo conversions was introduced nearly 40 years ago, but that hasn’t stemmed the gentrifying tide. The Concordia research study shows a steady decline in the availability of rental housing as more and more triplexes are being turned into condominiums. </p>

	<p><strong>The Research</strong></p>

	<p>No matter which side you’re on in the gentrification debate, the study’s findings are surprising: they show the proportion of rental units in La Petite-Patrie has decreased from 96 per cent of units in 1991 to 77 per cent of units in 2013.</p>

	<p>The study, led by Concordia professor Ted Rutland, also found that gentrification has affected some blocks more than others.</p>

	<p>Take St. André St., for example. The proportion of buildings offering rental accommodations dropped from 93 per cent, or 150 buildings, in 1991 to 35 per cent, or 57 buildings, last year.</p>

	<p>The students arrived at these numbers by analyzing 3,401 triplexes in the district, using government databases. The study was conducted in partnership with the Comité logement de la Petite-Patrie, a local tenant rights organization.</p>

	<p>“[The research project] comes out of the tradition of trying to treat the city as a learning space [&#8230;] but also contributing to it,” Rutland said.</p>

	<p>Not only did the study find a reduction in access to rental housing, it also shows that nearly half of condo conversions in La Petite-Patrie use the undivided co-ownership model, while the other half used the divided co-ownership model.</p>

	<p>Under undivided co-ownership, a building is owned collectively by all of its residents, with each resident owning a percentage of the whole building. The units aren’t divided into separate lots, but a management agreement may stipulate which unit is to be used by each resident.</p>

	<p>In contrast, divided co-ownership seeks to financially and legally separate each owner. Each resident owns only the specific unit they live in, as well as certain common areas like a backyard. This model is the one typically used in newly built condominium complexes.</p>

	<p>Undivided properties were traditionally seen as a riskier investment, as lenders previously offered only one mortgage for the entire building—linking the financial futures of each co-owner. </p>

	<p>Today, however, some lenders will provide individual mortgages to each co-owner, and insurance protects the co-owners in the event that one of them should be unable to pay their mortgage. Because taxes are calculated based on the whole property’s value, co-owners in an undivided building also pay lower taxes.</p>

	<p>In 1975, the provincial government implemented a moratorium on the conversion of apartment buildings into condominiums using the divided co-ownership model. The goal was to preserve the amount of rental housing available, reducing the vulnerability of renters.</p>

	<p>The moratorium remains in place in Montreal to this day, though the students’ research calls into question its effectiveness as government policy. The moratorium does not regulate the conversion of a rental property into an undivided condo building, which is now as common a form of co-ownership as divided properties are.</p>

	<p>Rutland said the ease of turning a rental property into undivided condos is one of the mechanisms through which gentrification is taking place in the neighbourhood while going almost entirely unnoticed by residents.</p>

	<p>“Most of us who live in a gentrifying neighbourhood would notice if they tore down a bunch of buildings and built new condos, or if they built new condos in a previously vacant lot—it’s very visible,” he said.</p>

	<p>“But the conversion to [undivided co-ownership] is something that happens behind the walls of buildings. Sometimes, it’s just a change in legal structure where, all of a sudden, a triplex that was rented out to three tenants is [&#8230;] in co-ownership and you don’t see anything.”</p>

	<p>Martin Blanchard of the Comité logement de la Petite-Patrie says the moratorium currently in place is ineffective because it doesn’t address the undivided co-ownership model.</p>

	<p>“A solution would be that undivided ownership stays as undivided ownership, not to create some type of pseudo-divided ownership in undivided ownership,” he said, referring to the protections and benefits that co-owners in an undivided building now enjoy.</p>

	<p>“It’s kind of fiscally unfair that people who have a divided condo pay much more tax than people who are in the undivided condos, while [in terms of] the market value, these [properties] are almost the same.”</p>

	<p><strong>The Pros and Cons of Gentrification</strong></p>

	<p>But should we be truly concerned by gentrification? Opinions are mixed on whether gentrification is a positive or negative phenomenon.</p>

	<p>“You’ll hear people talk about gentrification when they’re generally on the negative side of the issue, and you’ll hear people talk about economic revitalization if they’re more positive about it,” says Concordia professor Peter Morden of the rhetoric involved in the debate.</p>

	<p>In addition to displacing the residents of traditionally disadvantaged neighbourhoods through higher property values and rents, he notes that one of the negative consequences of gentrification is “greater pressure on the social infrastructure, [such as] ballparks and community centres, when there are a couple of competing groups for those kinds of spaces.”</p>

	<p>“Is it the case that not-for-profit youth sports [are] offered? Or is it the case that there are seniors’ leagues for some of the gentrifying population that would be willing to pay for the ice time? These kinds of competitions for scarce public resources can come up as well,” he said.</p>

	<p>But gentrification may also have some positive consequences on neighbourhoods, says McGill University urban planning professor Raphaël Fischler.</p>

	<p>“It diversifies the economic base of the neighbourhood with different stores, restaurants and cafés,” he said. “A wider range of services becomes available. Some of them are not accessible to the population that was there before because of price differences, but overall, it enlivens the neighbourhood to a certain extent. It brings more people into the neighbourhood, more activity.”</p>

	<p>Fischler also noted that gentrification can benefit cities’ coffers, as higher property values lead to more tax revenue. The neighbourhood’s physical infrastructure may also be improved either to set gentrification in motion or to respond to the needs of the population moving in, he said.</p>

	<p>Investments in infrastructure should be made regardless of whether or not an area is undergoing gentrification, however, argues Fred Burrill of P.O.P.I.R. &#8211; Comité Logement, an association of tenants in Montreal’s Sud-Ouest borough, which includes gentrifying areas such as St-Henri.</p>

	<p>“I think that the argument that people make for gentrification is that it brings with it a certain emphasis on green space and a building-up of the neighbourhood in terms of infrastructure, but those are things that should be done anyway,” he said. </p>

	<p>“I think it’s important to break the link between gentrification and positive public investment.”</p>

	<p>According to P.O.P.I.R. &#8211; Comité Logement, the solution to the problems caused by gentrification lies in building more social housing.</p>

	<p>“We think that, in fact, the private market can’t solve the housing crisis, can’t meet the needs of the vast majority of low-income people who need housing, and that the only thing that can do that is the widespread construction of subsidized social housing,” said Burrill.</p>

	<p>But for Annick Germain, a professor and researcher in the field of urban sociology at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique, the contemporary debate on gentrification and research into the topic largely misses the mark.</p>

	<p>She said the term “gentrification” and its French-language equivalent “embourgeoisement” have been co-opted by individuals involved in an ideological debate and are no longer useful as a subject of academic analysis.</p>

	<p>“These are notions that help groups make demands, and I find that it’s no longer a concept that is as useful as it used to be for doing research,” she said. “We put under the terms ‘gentrification’ and ‘embourgeoisement’ a ton of phenomena that are very different.”</p>

	<p>Historically, she says, a lot of working-class people were indeed displaced by gentrification as other social classes moved into their neighbourhoods and property values rose. </p>

	<p>“But today, things are more complicated and it’s reductionist to classify everything that’s going on in formerly working-class neighbourhoods under the term ‘gentrification,’” she continued.</p>

			<h3>With years of activism and successes opening co-operatives around Montreal under her belt, Order of Canada recipient Lucia Kowaluk came to Concordia Wednesday night to give some practical advice for aspiring activists looking to bring about change in the world around them.</h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

“The most important tool that you have to work with is yourself […] the more you know about yourself, the more useful you can be. I’m a leader, and I know that about myself,” Kowaluk explained. </p>

	<p>She says her training as a social worker allowed her to understand her strengths and weaknesses, and this, she continued, let her give her utmost to the causes close to her heart. </p>

	<p>Kowaluk stressed to the students that the most simple and legal techniques of organizing, such as petitions, protests, letters to the editor and going door to door, are often the most effective. </p>

	<p>The Milton Park Housing Project is Kowaluk’s most celebrated success. When a developer purchased the property in 1979 and wanted to demolish the community of Victorian houses to build modern buildings, Kowaluk worked with the community to prevent the large-scale destruction. The project is now the largest housing co-operative in North America. </p>

	<p>In the discussion period that followed the lecture, students asked for advice for any issue they were having difficulty making progress with. </p>

	<p>The topic of gentrification came up several times, and Kowaluk discussed strategies with other activists in attendance for dealing with the issue. </p>

	<p>On the topic of rising rents that push communities towards the city’s periphery, Kowaluk said, </p>

	<p>“The students studying at McGill are a major problem,” she said, referencing the rising rents caused by concentrated student habitation in the “McGill Ghetto” neighbourhood situated between the university’s campus and the Plateau. </p>

	<p>Kowaluk also recounted her encounter with Cesar Chavez in the late &#8217;60s at a cocktail party. </p>

	<p>“There’s only one way to organize people, and that’s one at a time,” she recalled him saying, which she added has stuck with her throughout her career.</p>

			<p><i>Concordia’s Own Michael Martini To Debut Two New Plays This Weekend</i></p>

			<p>This weekend, the MainLine Theatre is playing host to a theatrical double feature with deep Concordian roots. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The theatre will be showcasing two new plays, <em>Ivory Towers</em> and <em>Will-o-Wisps</em> by writer, director and actor Michael Martini, who also happens to be a Theatre student at Concordia. </p>

	<p>Although he has a background in acting (Martini plays the princely protagonist in <em>Will-o-Wisps</em>) from a performing arts school in Toronto, Martini said he always held some fascination with the written word, even while studying the craft of performing.</p>

	<p>“I would skip class and read plays instead,” Martini said, “I remember specifically reading <em>Lion in the Streets</em> on a whim, and immediately after that I couldn’t stop writing scenes.” </p>

	<p>The upcoming weekend is a hallmark event, because although both plays have been written and re-written in years past, this is the first time they will be presented in a more official venue and environment.</p>

	<p>“I’ve presented my writing here and there and directed a bit, but never on the scale of a professional show, so this production is definitely a monument for me,” Martini added.</p>

	<p>The plays are 20 minutes apiece, and will be put on back-to-back.</p>

	<p><em>Ivory Towers</em> centers around five female linguistics professors in a battle of words, seeing who can draw on the most thesaurus entries. Razor sharp wit required.</p>

	<p><em>Will-o-Wisps</em> takes place on the prom night of a young prince, locked away and waiting for his knight errant to come and rescue him. To keep him company, he has his imaginary friend, Dinah, who just happens to be an Academy Award-winning movie star.</p>

	<p>Martini himself isn’t the only Concordian involved, either.</p>

	<p>“I’m thrilled that people will see some of my ideas come to my life, but absolutely everyone involved—the actors, the designers—are establishing a presence [as well]. Most of the show’s designers are first year students, and the work they’ve done is incredible.”</p>

	<p>Beyond the upcoming theatrics of the weekend, Martini has an eye on continuing to work and contribute to the landscape of independent and student theatre in Montreal.</p>

	<p>He hopes that the pieces will resonate with enough meaning to result in both a pleased audience, and fuel demand and excitement over future productions. </p>

	<p>“We want to keep the blood of student theatre pumping in the city,” he said, “It’s important for me that <em>Ivory Towers</em> is an ensemble of five female characters, and that Will-o-Wisps has a gay protagonist. This isn’t something we get in the academic setting, and [is] something that I hope our peers will be proud to see happening.”</p>

			<p><i>CSU Talks With Admin Halt Renovation Plans</i></p>

			<p>Despite originally planning to reopen in January, Concordia’s campus bar will remain closed indefinitely.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Construction has yet to begin inside Reggie’s, Concordia’s student-run bar in the Hall Building mezzanine, while the university and the Concordia Student Union continue to discuss what infrastructure inside the space needs fixing, according to a report to <span class="caps">CSU</span> council by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp, the CSU’s for-profit arm.</p>

	<p>Following the bar’s closure in October, the renovation project managers were told by two separate contracting companies of maintenance and infrastructure problems, according to the report, with <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp chairperson James Tyler Vaccaro later elaborating the issues were mostly plumbing-related. </p>

	<p>“According to the current lease agreement these aspects fall under the legal obligation of the university to ensure the upkeep and repair,” stated the press release, released before the CSU’s regular council meeting last week. “In light of this clause, the [CUSAcorp Board of Directors] decided to approach the university to discuss our concerns with the state of the Reggie’s space, and to begin the process of working together on this project going forward.”</p>

	<p><span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp began discussions with the university at a meeting Dec. 6, where the Board presented to Concordia administrators their plans for the bar and surrounding space leased by the university to the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and managed by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp.</p>

	<p>Concordia’s Facilities Management was tasked with providing their own assessment of the infrastructure repairs needed, which only included a minor issue of pipes being wrapped in insulation.</p>

	<p>“From what we have been told by the contractors and project managers, as well as after having reviewed the space, in our estimation this is nowhere near the full extent of the space’s current issues,” the report continued.</p>

	<p>Vaccaro, also the <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Clubs and Internal Affairs, added in an interview with The Link that a third party at the behest of <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp will offer an independent evaluation to both the Board and the university.</p>

	<p>Vaccaro says the university welcomed the independent party performing its own inspection of the bar’s infrastructure. An agent of Facilities Management was unable to be reached for comment by press time.</p>

	<p>“If we all come to the table I think we can work together to create something great,” said Vaccaro.</p>

	<p>“I get the question everyday of when is Reggie’s reopening; I’ve been getting it since before we even closed it. If there’s anyone who would rather have Reggie’s open and up and running today, [that person] would be me,” he continued. </p>

	<p>That being said, Vaccaro adds the <span class="caps">CSU</span> wants to “make sure we’re doing it right,” even if that means Reggie’s won’t reopen anytime soon.    </p>

	<p>“We don’t want to rush through because if you’re rushing through the process just to get something open again, [it would be] doing a disservice to students in the long run,” he said.  </p>

					<p><br />

The annual John Molson <span class="caps">MBA</span> International Case Competition returned last week for its 33rd edition. The world’s oldest and largest case competition saw Concordia’s John Molson School of Business play host to 35 of the world’s most elite business schools for six days.</p>

	<p>Although <span class="caps">JMSB</span> did not win the competition—the University of Minnesota came away with first place—it still managed to break ground.</p>

	<p>“We are the first [case competition] ever to have a customized IT system to run the whole competition, from registration of volunteers and judges to calculating results and integrating results,” said organizer Leila Mosalaeepour.</p>

	<p>It may not sound like a huge leap forward, but fellow organizer Elliott Altilia says the change was like bringing case competitions from the 19th century to the present.</p>

	<p>Even the use of digital tools like PowerPoint presentations were not welcomed warmly at first by all competition participants this year, added Altilia, who coordinated volunteers and cases.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">JMSB</span> and 35 other teams were challenged over the course of the week in several cases—true-to-life business scenarios presented by past competition winners and companies.</p>

	<p>Over five days, 216 students competed for a $10,000 cash prize in hopes of taking home the Concordia Cup.</p>

	<p>Former Canadian governor general Michaëlle Jean presented this year’s live case, a real-life situation unveiled at the same time to all 36 teams.<br />
Jean’s appearance prompted the organizers to adjust the live-case format.</p>

	<p>“Usually, the presenter of the case is not announced until the day of the competition. This year, because of the notoriety of our presenter, we decided to disclose that Michaëlle Jean would be this year’s presenter,” said Altilia.</p>

	<p>The live case centred around the privatizing of Haiti’s power grid, something that is in the process of being debated right now in the Caribbean nation.</p>

	<p>According to Altilia, the real-world implications of the case gave teams the chance to offer solutions that could be used in Haiti in the future. Atilia explained that the case’s presenters, which included Jean and Haiti’s minister of energy security, René Jean-Jumeau, received each presentation on a <span class="caps">USB</span> stick with the hope that the information collected could provide new ideas for possible solutions.</p>

	<p>“I think you will be making such a difference for Haiti, this gathering is timely like you can’t imagine, it’s great,” said Jean, <br />
UNESCO’s special envoy for Haiti, in her opening address to students on Monday. </p>

	<p>Canada’s former governor general wasn’t the only high profile speaker present at the competition. A tradition of case competitions is to introduce businesses to upcoming talent, and at the competition banquet it was Michel Ouellette, Bombardier’s president of customer services and specialized and amphibious aircraft, who gave the closing keynote address.</p>

	<p>In an interview with <em>The Link</em>, Ouellette said the case competition allows Bombardier and others to pitch their worth as a company and find potential future leaders among the competition’s participants—and at <span class="caps">JMSB</span> in general. </p>

	<p>“The same way we’re such innovators in terms of what we do in everything we’ve put out in past years, the same openness exists within the company for leadership,” Ouellette said. </p>

	<p>“So if you’re ready to transform yourself as a leader and grow, Bombardier’s a company that’s going to listen to that and give you the chances.”</p>

	<p>According to Ouellette, case competitions are important practice, preparing students for the real risks involved in business and making them ready to embrace last-minute change.</p>

	<p>“One thing that really resonated with me is [when] I went to shake hands with the winning team […] one of their players did not make it in time, they had to have a replacement,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“And you wonder—one person is out, one person replaced—how do you win? And actually, it becomes an advantage. Through change came a great opportunity.”</p>

	<p>By allowing important lessons to be learned through a simulation, Ouellette said he believes the experience becomes invaluable to a future in business management.</p>

	<p>“No one loses, because if you participate in this thing, you’re bound to be with people of great mind and energy and that’s going to bring you something,” said Ouellette.</p>

	<p>“You learn different things about leadership throughout the years, but one of the key things is being in an environment that is stimulating, so coming to the case competition, that’s what it’s going to give you.”</p>

	<p>Despite not making it past the opening round, Ridge Foster of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz Graduate School of Business said the experience itself produced its own rewards.</p>

	<p>“Such a diverse range of talent, minds and ideas in one area, I think, is amazing and really speaks to the breadth and depth of John Molson and its international case competition,” he said.</p>

	<p>But there’s more to it than that, he added.</p>

	<p>“Beyond the ideas, beyond the competition, it’s just a lot of fun,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“It’s been a ride—the nerves, the competition, everything—there’s a lot of great things happening here.”</p>
