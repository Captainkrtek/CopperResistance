			<p>Traveling between campuses can be a pain.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Thankfully, a recent student-designed app listing the shuttle bus times has made the commute a little easier—that is, if you manage to find the app online.</p>

	<p>Creator of the newly-named <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.posthoffice.app&amp;hl=en">Shuttle App Project</a>, biology major Marc Posth, had to remove all references to Concordia in the app’s title or description at the request of the university administration. </p>

	<p>The university required the omissions out of concern that users mistake Posth’s app for one that is officially sponsored and run by Concordia, explained university spokesperson Chris Mota. In the past, another developer had to take down their shuttle bus app for the same reason. </p>

	<p>“I can’t use the Concordia logos or anything because it is made by me for students. I can’t steal their design,” said Posth.</p>

	<p>“I completely understand this issue, and expected it.”</p>

	<p>The simple Android-only app lists the bus times for both campuses and doesn’t require an internet connection to use. Posth updates the app to account for holidays, reading week and the exam period.</p>

	<p>A daily commuter on the shuttle bus when he was taking a full course load, Posth designed the app to make his trips easier and to learn the basics of Java on the Android platform. </p>

	<p>“Instead of taking pictures of the schedules, this is much more convenient,” he said. “The times are just two clicks away.”</p>

					<p>In 1952, homosexuals were considered sociopaths. The first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, at the time a new attempt to bring psychiatric nomenclature in line with the modern era, listed homosexuality as a pathological fear of the opposite sex. This listing remained for over 20 years until protests and improved research saw the seventh printing of the second edition, <span class="caps">DSM</span>-II, change the category to “sexual orientation disturbance.”</p>

	<p>The example points to a question that’s long haunted both the <span class="caps">DSM</span> and the concept of mental illness itself—how do we know what mental illness is? Whose definitions are legitimate and why?</p>

	<p>For most psychiatry professionals, the debate is less abstract. The <span class="caps">DSM</span>-5, published last May, has come under a newly energized wave of criticism that cites not only a lack of new research justifying a new edition, but a lack of scientific rigour altogether.</p>

	<p>“DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure,” wrote Dr. Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute for Mental Health in the United States and arguably the most powerful voice for re-orienting mental illness diagnosis towards a biological standard, in a post on the NIMH’s blog last year. “Symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. Patients with mental disorders deserve better.”</p>

	<p>Not even the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the <span class="caps">DSM</span>, is entirely confident in the staying power of psychiatry’s so-called “bible.” Jeffrey Lieberman, the president-elect of the <span class="caps">APA</span>, was quoted in The New York Times in May as saying, “The last thing we want to do is be defensive or apologetic about the state of our field. But at the same time, we’re not satisfied with it either. There’s nothing we’d like better than to have more scientific progress.”</p>

	<p>The obvious implication here is that people are getting misdiagnosed, and the consequences of that can be debilitating. But there’s another argument, perhaps obvious to the point of being virtually invisible, that non-biological ideas of mental health are misguided.</p>

	<p>A recent radio documentary on CBC’s Ideas, titled “Rethinking Depression,” explored the “epidemic” of antidepressant use that has emerged in the West since the introduction of drugs like Prozac and Zoloft to the market in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s.</p>

	<p>Its argument is that this increase in antidepressant use isn’t indicative of increased rates of major depression, but rather of a trend—spurred on by pharmaceutical companies—of diagnosing moderate depressive states as something worth medicating.</p>

	<p>These diagnoses are given legitimacy in the <span class="caps">DSM</span>, which itself is produced with heavy consultation from private interests—69 per cent of the task-force members on <span class="caps">DSM</span>-5 reported having ties to the pharmaceutical industry, the <span class="caps">PLOS</span> Medicine peer-reviewed journal reported in 2012.</p>

	<p>Edward Shorter, a historian focusing on psychiatry who was interviewed for “Rethinking Depression,” described the drafting of <span class="caps">DSM</span>-III—the edition that would become the template for contemporary mental illness diagnosis—as a matter of personal politics.</p>

	<p>“They basically sat around a big table and did horse-trading: ‘I’ll give you your diagnosis if you give me my diagnosis,’” he said.</p>

	<p>“Anybody who thinks the <span class="caps">DSM</span> is a scientific document really has got another thing coming. [The <span class="caps">DSM</span>] is what you learn as your professional compass to guide you through your professional life—[but] what you are learning is a lot of hocus-pocus,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“A good deal of the diagnoses makes sense. Some of the diagnoses don’t make sense, they don’t correspond to natural disease entities, and these happen to be some of the main diagnoses in psychiatry.”</p>

	<p>The argument is essentially that there are biological origins for mental illness that we’ve lost sight of, but the neural basis of mental disorders, what Weill Cornell psychiatry professor Richard A. Friedman calls “the holy grail of psychiatry,” remains elusive. Although most professionals now maintain that mental illness emerges from complex intersections of biological and environmental factors, there’s a recurring sense of urgency in discovering a primary cause.</p>

	<p>One is that we simply live in an unwell society. Jordan Peterson, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, placed much of the blame on late capitalism in his interview for “Rethinking Depression.” According to Peterson, our society exerts demands for unattainable perfection that are inevitably damaging.</p>

	<p>“If you do worldwide surveys of things like happiness, more industrialized countries are less happy,” he said. “And you think, ‘Well what the hell, why is that? Look at our standard of living!’ It’s like, ‘Yeah, and look at what you have to do to maintain that standard of living.’”</p>

	<p>It’s a condition that’s out of touch with reality, he explained.</p>

	<p>“Modern people think that life should be going well,” he said. “Life is too unlikely and entropically complex and fragile for you to expect that it’ll go well.”</p>

	<p>To Peterson, this skewed relationship to reality translates to the medicalization of normal human states that the <span class="caps">DSM</span> reinforces.</p>

	<p>“There [are] lots of people that use antidepressants instead of getting their life together,” he said. “Does it work? Well, antidepressants won’t fix a bad life.”</p>

	<p>This attitude, of course, can sound dangerously similar to the “suck it up” mentality that those suffering from mental illness have spent years trying to undo. It’s this tension that makes criticism of the current psychiatric model difficult to fully commit to—even if the <span class="caps">DSM</span> is unrealistic, it’s made mental illness much harder to ignore.</p>

	<p>“Fortunately, we don’t need a complete understanding of the neurobiology of mental illness to treat it,” Friedman wrote in response to a New York Times interview with Dr. Insel. “Medicine has always been practiced amid uncertainty.</p>

	<p>“Most of my colleagues laugh at the notion that the manual is a ‘bible,’” he continued. “[The <span class="caps">DSM</span>] is a practical way of describing psychiatric syndromes, clusters of symptoms that patients experience and that often predict a course of illness and responses to various treatments.”</p>

	<p>What Insel sees as a liability, Friedman sees as an asset.</p>

	<p>What we might take from the <span class="caps">DSM</span> controversy is an altered perception of the diagnosis of mental illness—not as rigid, limiting categories, but as tools to approach a person’s distress and find solutions.</p>

	<p>Whether it’s because of the brain’s baffling complexity or because of an immaterial reality to our thoughts, there’s something less tangible about mental health than physical health, and this requires a different understanding.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">DSM</span> is flawed, but these flaws need to be acknowledged alongside its strengths. Even if it’s a less-than-scientific document, our understanding of mental health has always been less—or more—than scientific in itself. In compassionate hands, even flawed tools can be worth preserving.</p>

					<p>Mental illness is one of the most pervasive elements in society—not all of us have been directly affected by it, but we’ll likely all experience it in some form during our lifetime, either personally or through someone else. Its presence in our lives makes its continued stigmatization all the more harmful, and with our first-ever mental health issue we have tried to continue the conversation in an attempt to break down some of the existing barriers.</p>

	<p>This issue is online-only because of the role that online communities can play in removing the stigma around mental illness. Online spaces provide the option of remaining anonymous, which can be hugely important when individuals discuss their experiences. Moreover, we wanted to create an immersive, multimedia space that reflects the diverse reach of the topic. Here are gathered stories, both journalistic and personal.</p>

	<p>Such a sensitive issue is bound to be touched by controversy and disappointment—as well as innovation and compassion. As the topic comes to greater prominence in the mainstream conversation, we want to apply critical thinking to both the positive and negative ways society handles our unreliable minds. There are always reasons to hope.</p>

					<h3>I was in my early twenties when I learned that my grandfather had committed suicide. I had never met him, but for as long as I can remember, I had just assumed his death was the work of a heart attack or old age. No one had ever spoken up to correct this with the more painful truth.</h3>

	<p><br />

When my older sister accidentally let it slip, her eyes gaped.</p>

	<p>“You didn’t know?”</p>

	<p>Over two decades of silence on the subject made it seem as though, suddenly, my ordinary family was not so ordinary. There was this sudden exposure of a dark secret, something my parents had kept from me—on purpose. Were they embarrassed by such a tragedy? Or had they done it to keep me safe?</p>

	<p>I’d like to think it was the latter. Even before I learned the truth about my grandfather, mental illness has been a long-time resident in our home. My youngest sister was diagnosed with <span class="caps">OCD</span> before she was 10 years old. As for me, I thought I was perfectly fine, until I cracked one day at the age of 17, in my first week at a brand-new job.</p>

	<p>Crying, breathing like a frightened locomotive careening for a cliff, I kept pulling myself together, only to fall to pieces again minutes later in a crescendo of sobs, late into the night. I quit that job and went into therapy almost immediately. I would later be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and social phobia, which I still contend with to this day.</p>

	<p>So when I learned that my grandfather had taken his own life, something clicked in my brain. I was not the first in my family to be at the mercy of their own mind.</p>

	<p>Had I inherited this sickness from an earlier generation? Were the seeds of that nameless, creeping fear and chemical instability in my very blood?</p>

	<p>According to an article published by the National Institute of Mental Health in March of last year, five major mental disorders, including major depression and bipolar disorder, were found to have a common genetic link. People suffering from these disorders tended to have genetic variations in the same four chromosomes. The article went on to say that although this discovery was statistically significant, the discovered genetic variation plays too small of a role in the risk of mental illness, and is therefore not very useful for diagnosis or prediction purposes.</p>

	<p>Still, my grandfather grew up in a time when it was even more taboo than now to talk about feelings that were odd or unsavory, let alone to be tested for anything mental-health related. He and my grandmother had both survived the Second World War. All my mom ever told me about him was that he was a man of few words who would often sit quietly in the dark.</p>

	<p>He never said anything, and my family never saw it coming.</p>

	<p>From the moment I had my first panic attack, my mother’s motto was, “Getting help is a sign of strength, not one of weakness.”</p>

	<p>I think it had roots in her father’s choice. In the grim light of learning about his suicide, every move she had ever made looked like it was done to prevent history from ever repeating itself. To her, every tearful teenage threat I have ever made, every terrible mood I had ever projected must have seemed like a desperate distress call. Every screaming match and slammed door would have said something insidious and unspoken: Look at what happened last time.</p>

	<p>It’s a fact that mental illness is more likely to be passed down in families, but it’s not guaranteed that if the parents have it, the children will too. Experts insist there are some environmental, personality and other factors that contribute to the origin of mental disorders in an individual.</p>

	<p>Once upon a time, I suffered from the thought that if I ever decided to start a family of my own, my kids would one day have the same nameless, surprise-attack breakdowns I used to be prone to on a regular basis. Even this is an unfair assumption.</p>

	<p>In fact, for all of our quirks and instabilities, my younger sister and I stand in contrast to our eldest sister, who navigated the mental minefield unscathed, perfectly normal.</p>

	<p>As the saying goes, you cannot pick your family, and it might be unfortunate, but you don’t get a say when it comes to your genes either. Until a time comes when we can predict with certainty that someone will have a mental illness, there can be no real way to know. Our genes are still a language we aren’t yet fluent in, so there is one other element of the family that is key when it comes to this modern epidemic: support.</p>

	<p>The Canadian Mental Health Association says that “[m]ental illness indirectly affects all Canadians … through a family member, friend or colleague.” If it’s not you, there’s a chance you know someone who has been affected.</p>

	<p>What I’m saying here is that this is not just my fight, my sister’s fight, my mother’s fight, or my grandfather’s fight. It’s a struggle that belongs to all of us.</p>

	<p>If you know someone close to you who you think might be suffering from a mental disease, the best thing you can do for them is to let them know you’re there, and encourage them to get help. Support might not be a cure, but a raised voice might be the difference between a success story and a family secret two decades old.</p>

	<p>If mental disorders have made homes in our genes, we need to make room for them with open minds, and open arms.</p>

					<p>“Hey, how’s it going?”</p>

	<p>“Fine, thanks. You?”</p>

	<p>It’s the type of conversation that happens every day at home, work or on campus—but is it genuine?</p>

	<p>Nampande Londe is trying to give fellow students a place to express how they’re feeling without fear of judgement. The centrepiece of her project, titled Not Fine, is a moderated web forum where users can share their experiences. If all goes to plan, the site will go online next month.</p>

	<p>Londe says inspiration for Not Fine came from her own struggle with anxiety and depression. Instead of being open about her feelings, she kept them bottled up.</p>

	<p>“I never used to talk about it because you have this idea that everyone is fine because they’re all going around saying ‘I’m fine, I’m fine,’” she said.</p>

	<p>“But really, they’re probably not fine either. You’re both probably about to have a breakdown, so we want to break through that silence.”</p>

	<p>When Londe presented the idea for her project in her classes, she was overwhelmed with messages of support and offers to volunteer.</p>

	<p>“I was surprised when I started talking about mental health issues how many people said, ‘I know exactly what you’re talking about, I’ve gone through that,’” she said.</p>

	<p>“That’s what makes me think we might just be scratching the surface.”</p>

	<p>Users will be able to post to Not Fine’s forum anonymously without having to provide proof of diagnosis or any other medical details.</p>

	<p>“We don’t want people to have to fit what they’re going through [into] a biomedical model,” Londe explained.</p>

	<p>She envisions the site as similar to the McGill Microaggressions Tumblr which encourages students, staff and professors to share their experiences of sexism, heteropatriarchy, transphobia, classism, racism and ableism.</p>

	<p>Londe hopes the site will act as a bridge connecting students in need of help with local resources, including Counselling and Development, the Gender Advocacy Centre and Suicide Action Montréal.</p>

	<p>Anna Frey, a volunteer for Not Fine, says the project will fill a gap in the support services offered at the university.</p>

	<p>“There is no space where students can immediately connect with one another, from the comfort of their own homes, to talk about their mental health,” she said. “We want to create a community so people know that though they may be feeling very alone, there are others who are experiencing similar things.”</p>

	<p>As non-professionals, the Not Fine team understands that it lacks the training to deal with suicide intervention or other difficult situations, so it’s reaching out to mental health experts for advice.</p>

	<p>In addition to the site, Not Fine’s volunteers are thinking about forming a support group and handing out care packages of tea and cookies to students during exam periods. They applied for $2,500 in funding from the <span class="caps">CSU</span> special projects fund, the Office of the Dean of Students, and the Concordia Council on Student Life to get the ball rolling.</p>

	<p>The Concordia Student Union showed its support for Not Fine by inviting Londe to speak at the last council meeting on Feb. 13.</p>

	<p>“I think it hits on something that’s very true of your university experience,” said <span class="caps">CSU</span> President Melissa Kate Wheeler. “The more we talk about these kinds of issues the more people will feel supported.”</p>

	<p>Last year, Wheeler started a similar project called Love Doesn’t Hurt, a campaign to raise awareness about abusive relationships and support victims.</p>

	<p>Once they get the project off the ground, Not Fine’s volunteers want to help train frosh leaders and offer help to students as early as their first week of university.</p>

	<p>“We want to let people know from the get-go that university is going to be hard emotionally, so here are some things that can help,” Londe said.</p>

	<p>Not Fine is looking for volunteers. If you’re interested, email nlonde@live.ca for more information.</p>

					<p>There is a condition in my family called fibromyalgia. Its main symptom is chronic and widespread muscle/tissue pain and sensitivity, but it can also result in fatigue, insomnia, migraines and a number of other unpleasant things. The brain of a person with fibromyalgia can be found to have structural and functional differences than someone who does not have it.</p>

	<p>That is about all a Wikipedia search—or even a medical encyclopedia—can definitively tell you about it: its symptoms, and that under a big machine sufferers’ brains sometimes look different. There is no cure, and treatment success varies unpredictably for each sufferer. It seems to stem from a combination of genetic, neurobiological, environmental and psychological factors, but the actual causes are still unknown.</p>

	<p>What I can tell you about it is that my mother and grandmother have it, and it sucks. I can tell you that just because you can’t point at a tumor, a scar or injured body part doesn’t mean they are faking it, or just being lazy when they can’t go into work. I can tell you that it isn’t easy to be told you have it—there’s something wrong with you that nobody scientifically understands; there is no surefire way to make it stop; you’re going to live with this to some degree your whole life. This is how I’ve come to understand people who suffer from things like addiction or depression.</p>

	<p>My mother first started experiencing unexplained physical pain in early adolescence. When she went to see a physician she was told it was growing pains, but these pains never really went away, lasting long after she’d definitely stopped growing.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, my mom was in a couple of accidents which seem to have exacerbated her condition, while remaining undiagnosed. These included sports injuries which lead to a concussion and six months in a back brace, whiplash (neck trauma increases the risk of developing fibromyalgia) resulting from a car accident and a wooden plank dropped on her head during home renovations. Anyone would have experienced pain, headaches and a number of other symptoms following these accidents, but these occurred between 15 and 35 years ago, and the pains persist today.</p>

	<p>Fibromyalgia is often associated with things like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Back in 1998, there was a bomb threat at the school my mother teaches at. It was discovered that there never was a bomb. The next day, she started hyperventilating and had her first panic attack, which at first was thought to have been a heart attack. Many tests found nothing physically wrong besides herniated discs, but those wouldn’t explain an attack. So my mother was given pills to take, should it happen again, to reduce the chest compression that makes panic attacks so scary.</p>

	<p>Over the years the pain continued and she saw various medical professionals who ruled out lupus, arthritis and multiple sclerosis before finally diagnosing fibromyalgia in 2006. Since, she’s seen doctors and specialists in rheumatology, neurology, acupuncture, physiotherapy, nutrition; she’s been prescribed different diets, exercises, vitamins, painkillers and anti-inflammatories.</p>

	<p>One thing that stands out to me, considering what is known about both my mother’s history and the nature of fibromyalgia, is that not once was she ever recommended to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist. Her symptoms are sometimes made worse by things that really have roots in psychology, like changes in temperature or air pressure. However, I know, she knows and her doctors knows that stress—like when she had to deal with a bomb threat in a school full of children—plays a huge role in how severe her muscle pain and migraines are.</p>

	<p>Whether fibromyalgia should be considered a medical illness or a mental disorder is a big topic of discussion in the medical and psychiatric communities. To me, this is an issue in and of itself. It is not because of my pride or my own stigma towards mental disorders that it bothers me what category my mother and others with fibromyalgia are filed under. What doesn’t sit well with me is that it’s implied that, without wholly understanding something that can cripple somebody to the point of not being able to get out of bed, people’s conditions are being categorized in a way which substantially changes how they are viewed and treated.</p>

	<p>This seems irresponsible to me—it seems to put problems people are having in one camp or the other. If asked, my mom will tell you in all confidence that the physical pain came first, decades earlier even, before any emotional pain or sadness arose. So I understand that this is a physical problem. However, if stress, trauma and mental health have a direct impact on this problem, why after this many years has a psychological approach not been recommended? I’m curious to know if, in the case of a depressed person suffering from physical pain, would a psychologist not recommend that person go to a physician?</p>

	<p>There seems to be an attitude in the minds of those on either side, those who treat the mind or the body, that they have all the answers. How many people might benefit from a broader view of health? What is going on within the medical community that a doctor, certainly not alone in his practice, would consider a condition which my mom suffers from daily “managed” because he cannot do anything more for her? What is going on in our society that many suffer every day without seeking help in the form of psychological or psychiatric practices?</p>

					<p>For Alex Manley, the decision to speak to someone in Concordia’s office of Counselling and Development came after the government ran a campaign raising awareness about mental illness. The campaign featured <span class="caps">PSA</span>s with messages about depression, urging people to reflect on their own feelings. Manley saw the ads and thought, “I might have depression.”</p>

	<p>“I failed all my classes that semester, things were looking pretty bleak. I wasn’t going out, I was having suicidal thoughts,” he said.</p>

	<p>He sought help from Concordia Health Services and was told that they didn’t think he was depressed, but recommended he speak to someone in Counselling and Development. In early 2008 he started speaking to a counsellor, who he saw on and off for roughly three years.</p>

	<p>The therapy sessions Manley went to are one form of treatment Counselling and Development offers. Last year, approximately 10,000 students contacted the office for support according to director Howard Magonet, meaning that counsellors and psychiatrists typically saw three to five students a day.</p>

	<p>At Concordia, mental health services are divided into two categories: services provided by Counselling and Development, and those handled by Health Services. Services are offered on both campuses, and for Counselling and Development there are roughly 12 counsellors and psychologists on staff to attend to the needs of students.</p>

	<p>The problems Magonet says counsellors deal with most frequently are in line with what a 2013 study done by the Canadian Association of University Student Services found—most students seek help for issues related to anxiety, depression and relationships.</p>

	<p>According to the 2013 Canadian Community Health Survey, individuals aged 15-24—a category that includes the majority of university students—are more likely to develop mental difficulties than any other age group. It’s no secret, and the prevalence of mental illness among university-age students means that the resources to support them have to be there—and they have to be strong.</p>

	<p>It’s precisely the strength of the services—as well as the length of each session—that Jason* questions.</p>

	<p>“Forty-five minutes once every two weeks isn’t enough time to get to know the spectrum of what’s really going on,” he said, adding that his experience with Counselling and Development was good, but up to a point.</p>

	<p>Their services seem to be designed as a supplement to counselling that students can receive outside of school, he says, but that brings in a very obvious problem: cost.</p>

	<p>“My therapist [outside of school] is like $175 an hour and a lot of families can’t afford that,” Jason said.</p>

	<p>The often-costly price tag of therapy at a private clinic means that for many, in-school counselling is the only option. For Magonet, the triage approach adopted by Counselling and Development helps to mitigate this.</p>

	<p>“Everyone who comes to see us for personal counselling has a triage appointment with one of our professional psychologists. During this time we take a look at their full schedule of functioning, we look at their home life, their student life, relationships, everything that we need to do,” he said. “Through that we develop the parameters of our treatment program.”</p>

	<p>Manley’s experience interacting with his counsellor shows the positive interactions students can have. He’d visit Counselling and Development intermittently, a few times every month or so, and then come back six months later “in the middle of a crisis, and [the counsellor] was always very accommodating as far as seeing me again.”</p>

	<p>The value of these services is plainly obvious, and neither Manley nor Jason question that for a minute.</p>

	<p>“Before I got to Counselling and Development I had absolutely one of the worst, most stressful couple months of my life [&#8230;] I was completely lost, kind of drowning in an incapacity to deal with my life,” Manley said.</p>

	<p>“The return on my investment was massive. I spent not a lot of time over a span of three years, it didn’t cost me anything, it was huge for me as a person, and to that end I can only imagine how potentially huge it can be for people who are in even more need of it,” he continued.</p>

	<p>Jason’s situation brings to light one of the significant aspects of therapy services provided at Concordia. But what do you do when someone’s condition is beyond your control as a therapist to work on?</p>

	<p>“If we happen to see somebody who requires additional resources to individual counselling, then, for example, in-house we could refer them to Health Services to see a psychiatrist,” Magonet explained. “In our facilities we can only offer out-patient services. If we start to see that they require something that is more elaborate than that then we make referrals to different hospitals, <span class="caps">CLSC</span>s, depending on the issue that’s presenting.”</p>

	<p>Jason acknowledged that his reasons for seeking help were perhaps more severe than other students’ reasons, but ultimately found that Counselling and Development “just [doesn’t] have the resources and the time to get into the major issues with students that need more than just [advice on] how to balance life.”</p>

	<p>The counsellor he interacted with was helpful, but he stressed the importance of a well-developed relationship between a therapist and their patient.</p>

	<p>“She was as helpful as she could have been, but because she didn’t know me—and my medical illnesses are quite severe—what she and I worked on was balancing how to get up every morning, how to set aside two hours every evening to do homework,” he said. “It wasn’t really talking about the issues that caused the problems of me not to succeed in school.”</p>

	<p>For students like Jason, the issue isn’t whether or not the service being provided is good or bad—the question is whether it can really make an impact.</p>

	<p>“If they could give an hour and a half or two hours I bet they would, because they are there to help, and they care about their patients,” Jason said. “It’s just difficult when [they have] a thousand or 500 other students [they] probably see.”</p>

	<p>Magonet says that he feels Counselling and Development has the appropriate resources to deal with a diversity of student needs because they know their limits.</p>

	<p>“We know that if we can see them here we will, and we also know that if we have to see them in conjunction with some type of referral we will. The main thing is to be a holding place for them until they can find some resource outside of here that will maintain that relationship as well,” he said. “We won’t leave anybody in the lurch.”</p>

	<p>In a university that has enrollment rates in the tens of thousands, finding a model for support that is as inclusive as possible to the diversity of student needs can be a formidable task. Still, there is little to suggest the university is not trying to create a supportive, effective framework for students.</p>

	<p>In a school of about 45,000 students, there are many who need help. For some, Concordia is the only place they can get it.</p>

	<p>*name has been changed.</p>

					<p><strong>Life as a Tennis Ball in the Quebec’s Medical System</strong><br />
By Anonymous</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s been four months since I first sought mental health treatment in the Quebec medical system, and it&#8217;s fair to say that my experience has resembled a slow-motion tennis game in purgatory, with me as the tennis ball.</p>

	<p>I first attempted to get help in October. I was temporarily out of town, panicked, hopeless and thinking of killing myself.</p>

	<p>I called Info-Santé, and they told me to go see a social worker at a Local Community Services Centre (<span class="caps">CLSC</span>). I did, and she gave me an appointment with a mental health doctor three weeks later. The doctor diagnosed me and gave me a prescription, saying I would feel better within about six weeks. He advised me to look online for a private psychologist, as it would take over four months to get a public one.</p>

	<p>By the time I got back to Montreal, it was clear that the meds weren&#8217;t helping. I hadn’t been referred to a <span class="caps">CLSC</span> in town, so I called Info-Santé again. I was given a list of phone numbers, mostly public-private clinics, and was told to call and ask whether they had a psychiatrist that was taking new patients. No luck.</p>

	<p>I went to see the social worker at my local <span class="caps">CLSC</span> to try and make sense of it all, and to see if she could make me an appointment with a mental health doctor. She couldn’t. They don&#8217;t have that kind of doctor at that <span class="caps">CLSC</span>, although she said they&#8217;d like to. She recommended that I go to a walk-in clinic to get my medication adjusted. I put it off for about a week, until a dark afternoon when I realized that if I didn’t see a doctor, I was going to die.</p>

	
				<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/Special/22-5mh.coping6_540_559_90.jpg" alt="" />
								</div>
				

	<p>I googled &#8220;urgence psychiatrique montreal&#8221; and found the web page for Hospital Y. I took a cab there, checked in and was seen by a psychiatric resident after a waiting a few hours. He adjusted my medication but told me that I&#8217;d come to the wrong hospital: I don’t live in their sector, so they&#8217;d have to transfer my case to Hospital X for my follow-up appointment. He told me it’d take about a week.</p>

	<p>It took three weeks. Except it wasn’t Hospital X that called, it was a social worker from a <span class="caps">CLSC</span> affiliated with Hospital X, because Hospital X doesn&#8217;t take psych patients unless they have a family doctor. I&#8217;m on the priority waiting list for a family doctor, but I’ll still have to wait four months before getting one.</p>

	<p>I met with the social worker. Five minutes in, she said, &#8220;You need to see someone now.&#8221; She pulled some strings to get me a spot at Hospital X, but the wait time is five weeks. In the meantime, she &#8220;made an agreement&#8221; with a nurse at Hospital Y to have them do a follow-up there. I took another cab across town: it was then that the tennis analogy came to mind.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s the daily embarrassment and demoralization that comes with being mentally ill. The dirty hair, the wrinkled shirts, the missed classes, the unanswered invitations. The lame cheerlessness of answering “non” to my roommates&#8217; daily “ça va?”&#8216;s.</p>

	<p>The ordeal of the psych emergency room, of crying uncontrollably as the security guard searches my purse for drugs for and scans my body with a metal detector. The fluorescent lights and vinyl chairs of waiting rooms, their miniature boxes of low-grade kleenex.</p>

	<p>The way I lower my eyes during weekly visits to the pharmacist, knowing that he knows full well why my prescription only allows me a small number of pills at a time. The permanent switch to waterproof mascara. The painful intensity of my emotions, and the hopelessness of having no control over them.</p>

	<p>I was asked for a personal story about getting better, living or coping with mental illness for this issue, but I&#8217;m afraid that’s not something I can give yet. I want to get better, but that requires getting help. Wait times are atrocious and navigating the bureaucracy is almost impossible. If I was any farther gone, I&#8217;d have likely given up trying by now.</p>

	<p>The tragedy is that the majority of the doctors, nurses and social workers I&#8217;ve seen have been extremely competent—they care about my wellbeing and take the time to understand my illness, it&#8217;s just getting into their office that&#8217;s the problem. I can&#8217;t help but wonder how many people don&#8217;t survive the wait.</p>

	<p>Gradually, on darker days it leads me to the conclusion that the society I live in doesn&#8217;t really care if I get better or not.</p>

<strong>A Success Story of Battling Depression</strong><br />
By David S. Landsman</p>

	<p>It’s a good thing I know how to smile. I remember a time in elementary school where a peer told me I’m the kind of guy who could get punched in the face, fall down and come up smiling.</p>

	<p>Life hasn’t always been the easiest for me. I’ve been in and out of Concordia University ever since I started at this fine institution back in January 2007. I didn’t start out on the right foot, and now, seven years later, I still don’t believe I’ve found my true path.</p>

	<p>For me, coming to Concordia was a sort of escape from my personal drama. I was battling depression, and I had just finished at Dawson College after three-plus years, finally completing my college degree in cinema in a year that had been hell to say the least.</p>

	<p>I was in a destructive relationship where I had lost all but a couple of my friends because I didn’t want to lose her. In the end I lost both her and the friends I had made over my lifetime.</p>

	<p>My last semester at Dawson was overshadowed by an incident on the morning of Sept. 13, 2006, the day my school at the time, my place of escape when not at home or at work, was the scene of a horrendous attack. Twenty-five-year-old Kimveer Gill, a man so angry at society and people, decided to walk into the de Maisonneuve entrance armed with guns and shot at innocent people, killing one and wounding 19.</p>

	<p>I still remember the moment I found out, because I was fortunately at my parents’ home making lunch with someone I thought was a friend. He was a person who had an obligation to lie about everything; it was his compulsion. I got shudders every time I walked into the school following the incident, and still do.</p>

	<p>After that, and the breakup, my mother and I believed it would be a great idea to continue pursuing my education at Concordia, where I had been accepted a couple of months prior.</p>

	<p>I started a couple of weeks late, which didn’t help me with getting stabilized, although I made some good new friends and reconnected with some of my peers from Dawson and high school.</p>

	<p>However, the happiness of being in a new place got hit with another bang. This time, within two weeks of starting classes, a friend of mine from my first high school told me that one of our peers, Ryan, who was also in my Sociology of Sport class, had died suddenly that past weekend at the age of 20. It was from a heart attack, which at 20 sounds just too surreal. When I went to his wake, it caught me like a giant gust of wind, pushing me down.</p>

	<p>Things did get slightly better. I made some new friends, I started learning new things and became a part of society again.</p>

	<p>I did see a clinical psychologist for some time—and that helped too, although maybe not my mother’s bank balance. It helped me have someone to talk to who could understand me and give me suggestions on how to pursue the greener pastures in life. He suggested medication, but for me that’s never been a thing, and to this day, I have never taken any meds for this “condition.”</p>

	<p>I believe having strong support behind me, and by my side, has helped me better myself as a person.</p>

	<p>And although I am still struggling with a few things in my life, it always makes me smile to know there are people who are there to help me through not-the-easiest time.</p>

	<p>Depression is not something to be overlooked, and it doesn’t seem to ever fully go away, but that strong support and a healthy lifestyle can go a long way. Now I smile every day, and people know I’m not faking it.</p>

<strong>On Self-Harm and Healing</strong><br />
By Erin Sparks</p>

	<p><span class="caps">TRIGGER</span> <span class="caps">WARNING</span>: This content deals with an account of self-harm and may be upsetting to some readers.</p>

	<p>The first time I cut myself I was 13, maybe 14.</p>

	<p>I know I’m supposed to remember how old I was exactly. I know I’m supposed to remember specific details about the first time, about that instant when I tried something I’d never tried before and found something I thought I needed. But the truth is that for so much of that year, whatever year it was, I felt like the entire world was swirling around me in an impossibly complicated way. I didn’t take in much of anything.</p>

	<p>I remember other things, though. I remember piling bracelet on top of bracelet so that nobody could see my arms, but so I could still wear the shirt I liked, the one with the short sleeves. I remember realizing that wasn’t working, that the bracelets made too much noise in class and only drew attention to me.</p>

	<p>I remember making armwarmers that covered the marks I’d made on myself and I remember when my sewing teacher saw something she shouldn’t have and pulled me aside during class. I remember the stupid lie I tried to tell the school counsellor. “I was picking blackberries. There were thorns.”</p>

	<p>I remember how my mother cried, and how I cried too because all I could think was how much I’d hurt her, how I never wanted to hurt her, and how I had to stop harming myself because seeing her cry was the worst feeling in the world.</p>

	<p>I never wanted to die. I think that a lot of people have the misconception in their minds that people who harm themselves are suicidal, that they want to go further but can’t yet, that it’s this sort of build-up to the grand finale. But I never wanted to die. I knew that a single mistake could lead to that—down the road, not across the street—but I was always careful. Ritualized.</p>

	<p>I thought that because I knew I wasn’t suicidal then everyone else would somehow also know and would leave me alone to take care of myself in the way I thought was right. But in retrospect I understand what a ridiculous idea that was. I needed help, and I understand that now.</p>

	<p>I started going to therapy. That was the deal. Go to therapy, and we’ll see how it goes. We’ll see if you get better.</p>

	<p>I hated my therapist in the beginning. I was still convinced that I was fine, that I could handle things on my own, and the idea of talking to a stranger about things they could never possibly understand was the opposite of what I wanted. Over time though, I became more comfortable around her. We’d meet weekly, and I’d call her by her first name and we’d talk about things that weren’t related at all to what I was doing to myself.</p>

	<p>At first I thought it was stupid. If I was sick—damaged—then why weren’t we talking about that? Why weren’t we talking about my scars, or how I’d dig my nails into my palms until they bled because I felt such immense darkness and anxiety inside my body that I didn’t know what else to do?</p>

	<p>As I started to get better, I realized that it didn’t matter that we never directly addressed what was going on. I just needed someone to listen, someone who could find other ways of getting me to talk about what was going on, without forcing me to attach a name or definition to what I was feeling.</p>

	<p>Most of my scars have faded as my body heals itself, but you can still see a few of the deeper ones. When I get flushed, which is often, you can see the pale lines more clearly, and then I grow anxious that this will somehow bring back the feelings that left me so barren, that made me terrified of myself.</p>

	<p>I was lucky because someone noticed what was going on—I’m honestly not sure what would have happened if that teacher, or the close friend who saw and told her father, hadn’t said something. But when I think about that I feel dizzy and hot, so I can’t think about it yet.</p>

	<p>These feelings come in bursts now, little explosions of anxiety that try to consume me, but I’m better at addressing it than I was before, because I’m actually addressing it. I’m not pushing it into the furthest corner of my mind where I can pretend it doesn’t exist, that everything is fine</p>

	<p>I don’t remember the first full day that I felt better, and I don’t think there even was one. Realizing that constantly being at war with yourself is not the only way to live isn’t something that happens overnight—it takes time, and I’m getting there.</p>

			<p>A crowd of around 700 waded through Montreal’s downtown core on Valentine’s Day for the Annual Memorial March for Murdered and Missing Women. </p>
			
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				

				
					<p>“Between us, we are capable of depending less on a police force and judicial system that continues to perpetuate violence,” Alisha Mascarenhas told the crowd. Mascarenhas is a member of Missing Justice, the grassroots solidarity group that organized the event.</p>

	<p>“We should not have to wait on a government that remains passive, irresponsible and negligent. It’s up to us to defend ourselves against violence.” </p>

	<p>Held across Canada, the memorial march pays homage to murdered and missing indigenous women and denounces violence perpetrated against those who identify as women anywhere in the world. The march began in 1991 in Vancouver, after the murder of a First Nations Coast Salish woman. The woman’s name is not spoken today out of respect for her family.</p>

	<p>Over 600 indigenous women have been killed or gone missing in Canada since 1980, according to an estimate from the government-recognized Native Women’s Association of Canada.</p>

	<p>Other activists count the number of deaths and disappearances closer to 3,000. More than half of the recognized cases remain unsolved.</p>

	<p>The Montreal march was part of a larger speaker series, Thick Skin: Reflections on race, gender, and political resistance, happening at Concordia. </p>

	<p>Around 6 p.m., the crowd grew at Parc Émilie-Gamelin, where a microphone was set up. Police cars lined the adjacent street as journalists’ cameras flashed, the park coated with fresh snow. </p>

	<p>“Society at large is just as guilty as the institutions, because we do nothing to change,” said Anna-Aude Caouette from <span class="caps">STELLA</span>, a community resource group for sex workers.</p>

	<p>She was one of multiple speakers who noted participants were standing on unceded Aboriginal territory, referring to North America as ‘Turtle Island’ according to Native oral tradition.</p>

	<p>Caouette underlined how difficult it is for women who need help, saying native women often fear violence and discrimination from the government and its institutions.</p>

	<p>“Police are not an option because they have killed and raped with impunity for far too long!” she told the crowd.</p>

	<p>Maya Rolbin-Ghanie, founder of Missing Justice, read <a href="http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/bwss/2014/02/why-i-march-annual-memorial-march-missing-and-murdered-women-montreal">an open letter</a> to the crowd.</p>

	<p>The diverse crowd marched from Berri-<span class="caps">UQAM</span> Metro to Place-des-Arts along Ste. Catherine St.</p>

	<p>Phil Rispe said he was marching for his friend Joelle, an aboriginal woman killed in Quebec City last summer. He said her case was never pursued. </p>

	<p>“I just think in my head, ‘how is it possible for people to do that to another person?’” he said. Rispe is from Bolivia but lives in Montreal. </p>

	<p>“Native murder is not important for the government. For the white people? ‘Oh, we need to make that so important on the front page.’ For the native people? ‘Fuck off.’”</p>

	<p>Unsolved cases are what motivate repeated demands for a public inquiry to investigate the roots of systemic injustice in Canada.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">NWAC</span> recently sent a petition of over 23,000 signatures to the House of Commons. In this year’s budget, the federal government renewed funding for existing public programs aimed to reduce violence against aboriginal women and girls. They have not replied about the inquiry, which activists equate with doing nothing.</p>

	<p>Mascarenhas said a public inquiry is essential in terms of widening visibility, but that action shouldn’t stop there.</p>

	<p>“If I have any primary concerns about a public inquiry, it would be on whose terms and in what framework would that inquiry be happening, and who would be doing the actual research involved,” she said.</p>

	<p>“We can see that when research goes from being done by native-lead groups and then is handed over to the government, how they can have very different motivations—and come up with very different findings—that has different impacts.”</p>

	<p>She said funding should go to native-led organizations “that are coming from the experiences of people who are directly affected by this kind of violence.”</p>

			<p><i>Former President Asks for Reconsideration 10 Months Later</i></p>

			<p>Caroline Bourbonnière won&#8217;t be getting her $1,500 bonus from last year. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Nearly <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4371">10 months after being refused an end-of-year bonus for helping to plan a speaker series that went $19,100 over budget,</a> the former Arts and Sciences Federation Associations president was again denied in a landslide vote by <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council last night. </p>

	<p>Bourbonnière was not present for the vote that dismissed her request, but speaking to <em>The Link</em> beforehand she said she was prompted to motion for her forfeited bonus because of the treatment she received in the fallout after the <span class="caps">ASFA</span> Talks 2013 speaker series.</p>

	<p>“This is inhumane,” said Bourbonnière. “I’m doing this to go and take what’s mine, because I worked above and beyond my mandate in so many ways and worked through the worse climate you could even fucking imagine.”</p>

	<p>Bourbonnière’s $1,500 bonus was used by <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council to help pay off the losses of <span class="caps">ASFA</span> Talks 2013, <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4180">a multi-disciplinary speaker series</a> that took place last March.</p>

	<p>But Bourbonnière told <em>The Link</em> last year the event was well-executed but poorly advertised. She added in an interview last week that she tried to fundraise over $6,000 after-the-fact, something not expected of any president or <span class="caps">ASFA</span> member when a project falls into the red.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">ASFA</span> council had voted to impeach Bourbonnière near the end of her presidential term at a meeting on April 5, 2013.</p>

	<p>About fifty-five per cent of <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council voted to impeach Bourbonnière for her part in organizing <span class="caps">ASFA</span> Talks 2013, short of the two-thirds majority required for impeachment. </p>

	<p>The extra $19,100 allocated to <span class="caps">ASFA</span> Talks was used to secure keynote speaker Jeff Rubin, the former chief economist at <span class="caps">CIBC</span> World Markets, but Bourbonnière also signed off on a contract without a second signing officer to enlist Robin Lim, <span class="caps">CNN</span> 2011 Hero of the Year and founder of the Healthy Mother Earth Foundation, which provides free access to prenatal care in Indonesia.</p>

	<p>According to current <span class="caps">ASFA</span> president Paul Jerajian, the event only raised $294 in ticket sales, although hosting it cost over $30,000.</p>

	<p>In a letter to <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council outlining her decision to seek her forfeited bonus, Bourbonnière asserted Jerajian refused to sign in at a May meeting reevaluating the loss of her bonus, “unless the other councillors agreed not to reconsider the motion.”</p>

	<p>She also made reference to Jerajian’s part in attempting to impeach her during her tenure as president, but does not name her successor by name.</p>

	<p>“It’s completely within my rights to not sign into a meeting,” Jerajian countered, adding he did not sign in because the meeting meant to reconsider Bourbonnière’s motion had less people in attendance than the original meeting that decided end-of-year bonuses.</p>

	<p>Jerajian says he does not consider himself to be the spearhead behind Bourbonnière’s impeachment, saying he was “only one vote.”</p>

	<p>Nikos Pidiktakis sat on <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council last year as the representative for Political Science Student’s Association, of which Bourbonnière was VP Communications during the 2010-2011 academic year.</p>

	<p>He says he offered testimony to <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council at Thursday’s meeting in response to Bourbonnière “attacking his character” and sending him “a series of unprofessional text messages” following his being critical over a closed <span class="caps">ASFA</span> Facebook group of Bourbonnière’s decision to seek her bonus again.</p>

	<p>In those messages, which <em>The Link</em> obtained in their entirety, Bourbonnière said she “felt betrayed” by Pidiktakis’ comments on the group page, and that he “had no idea what he was talking about.”</p>

	<p>“[Her motion for her forfeited bonus] was unparliamentary, unprofessional and as well, I honestly thought she put such a skeleton back in the proverbial closet,” Pidiktakis told <em>The Link</em>.</p>

	<p>Bourbonnière says she has “been meaning to take care of [getting her bonus back] since September,” but her duties as VP External for the Concordia Student Union were more important and time-demanding.</p>

	<p>But multiple members of <span class="caps">ASFA</span> have told <em>The Link</em> they view Bourbonnière’s attempting to get her bonus back now as both unprofessional and too late.</p>

	<p>For Pidiktakis, he says it’s just detracting from the good job Bourbonnière has done for the Concordia Student Union.</p>

	<p>“I have worked with her this whole year on the Divest Concordia campaign and helping her out on ideas for speakers,” he said.</p>

	<p>“It is actually and truly sad as she was doing good work as our VP External.”</p>

	<p>As for Bourbonnière, she says her motion to council was looking for them to reconsider more than just her bonus.</p>

	<p>“I wanted council to understand what had happened [last year],” she said before last week’s <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council meeting. </p>

	<p>“I’m being told that this is not the appropriate way to deal with this, that it’s over, that it’s in the past, that [this year’s <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council is not aware of the whole situation] but they’re completely removed from the situation so that they can look only at the facts, and that’s what’s important.”</p>

			<p><i>Union Set to Move Beyond Bargaining</i></p>

			<h3>Union leaders say Concordia negotiators refused to acquiesce to the pay and benefit demands of the Teaching and Research Assistants at Concordia at a bargaining session Feb. 11, leading to the creation of a strike committee to examine alternative forms of action at a general assembly Thursday night.</h3>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p><br />

“[The new committee sends] a very clear statement that [union members are] not happy with the current collective agreement and they want changes, and based on the way negotiations are going so far, they see the need to take further action rather than accept what’s on the table,&#8221; said <span class="caps">TRAC</span> President Adam Szymanski.</p>

	<p>Union members at the meeting were told their pay demands could not be met because of a clause in previous union bargaining agreements, which requires the university to increase the pay for each union by the same amount should a single union receive a pay increase of over two per cent as part of their new collective agreement.</p>

	<p>Szymanski says that he respects that reason insofar as it ensures all unions benefit when one does, but that teaching assistants need “in some regard to have different treatment,” because they have to pay tuition to even qualify for their jobs, and therefore their pay ought to cover their tuition as well as living expenses, he said.</p>

	<p>Bargaining officer Erik Chevrier mentioned that many TAs are expected to grade more papers without an increase in hours, leading many to say the quality of their work has been compromised.</p>

	<p>Robin Graham, a graduate student in the English department, said that he was in charge of a much smaller class than some of his colleagues, so they worked out an informal agreement where he took on some of their workload to make everyone’s task more manageable.</p>

	<p>Similarly, a union member and PhD student in film and imaging studies said that he had to grade many more papers than were set out in his contract.</p>

	<p>University spokesperson Chris Mota was unable to provide Concordia’s position on the negotiations. </p>

	<p>“As is the case with all collective bargaining, we do not discuss the content of negotiations. However, I can tell you that we are working diligently to reach an agreement,” she said.</p>

			<p><i>Petitions to Opt-Out of Six Fee Levy Groups, Change Voting Procedure Presented to Council</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/News/21CA.CSU(Brandon_Johnston)_690_458_90.jpg" alt="" />

			<p>Business students are looking to opt-out from six fee levy groups en masse, and to change how new groups get their funding.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Two petitions were presented to Concordia Student Union Chairperson Nick Cuillerier by John Molson School of Business councillor Michael Richardson at the Feb. 12 council meeting. </p>

	<p>If put to ballot as referendum questions in the upcoming <span class="caps">CSU</span> general elections and voted in by undergrads, all <span class="caps">JMSB</span> students will stop paying six fee levies and how groups can request fees from undergrads will be permanently changed.</p>

	<p>The first petition proposes that any request for funding “for any group that is not directly and completely controlled by the CSU” is to be done on a “per faculty basis,” instead of the current system where a majority of voters decide on fee levies for the entire student body.</p>

	<p>The second seeks to have <span class="caps">JMSB</span> undergrads forgo paying fees to the Art Matters Festival, Cinema Politica, Community University Television, the Concordia Food Coalition, le Frigo Vert and Quebec Public Interest Research Group-Concordia.</p>

	<p>The combined cost of the six fee levy groups is $1.21 per credit.</p>

	<p>“These changes reflect what the faculty thinks, believes and logically it makes a lot of sense,” said Kabir Bindra, who represents <span class="caps">JMSB</span> on the <span class="caps">CSU</span> council. “No longer will <span class="caps">JMSB</span> students waste their money on groups most have never heard of and on groups that provide no services or benefits to them.”</p>

	<p>Students are automatically charged fee levies, and must opt-out of each fee individually if they do not wish to pay. A majority “yes” vote from undergraduates during the March general elections is required to pass these changes.</p>

	<p>The petitions were successful in attaining 500 signatures, the requirement for calling a referendum according to <span class="caps">CSU</span> bylaw 9.6. Cuillerier has verified that at least 500 signatures on each petition were valid.</p>

	<p>The three official representatives for the petition are executives on the Commerce and Administration Student Association—CASA President John-Michael Minon, VP Academic Loïc Sanscartier and Richardson, who is the association&#8217;s VP External.</p>

	<p>A special council meeting is being held on Feb. 19 at 2:00 p.m. in the <span class="caps">CSU</span> lounge to further discuss these petitions.</p>

	<p><em>More to come.</em></p>

					<p>After longtime Stingers football head coach Gerry McGrath <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4864/">announced his retirement last October</a> following a disappointing 0-8 season, the responsibility of finding his replacement fell in the hands of Concordia’s director of Recreation and Athletics, Patrick Boivin. </p>

	<p>Today, Boivin and his staff believe they have found their man for the challenge: former Stingers linebacker Mickey Donovan.</p>

	<p>“He is definitely our guy for the job, [we are] very excited to have him,” said Boivin. “He understands the mentality and this generation of student-athletes and young adults—that it needs to be a partnership if you want them to buy into you or believe in you.”</p>

	<p>As for Donovan, 33, who played three seasons as linebacker for the Stingers from 2002 to 2004, coming to Concordia was an obvious choice for him.</p>

	<p>“I’m really just excited that I’m back home, home is Concordia,” said the New Hampshire-born Donovan. “This is where my life for Canadian football began, and it’s be nothing but good to me here. I owe a lot to Coach McGrath who brought me up here.”</p>

	<p>While at Concordia, Donovan was a two-time Quebec all-star as well as a two-time All-Canadian in Canadian Interuniversity Sport. In 2004, his final year wearing the Maroon and Gold, he also won the President’s Trophy for top defensive football player in the country. He then played in the Canadian Football League with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats before a knee injury forced him to retire.</p>

	<p>Prior to his newly-appointed position this morning, Donovan was also part of the coaching staff for the Western Mustangs, coaching the linebackers from 2007 to 2011, and most recently was an assistant coach and defensive coordinator for Concordia’s cross-town rivals, the McGill Redmen.</p>

	<p>“When I played here, our rivalry was always McGill,” said Donovan. “And now that I’ll coach here, it’ll still always be McGill. It’s also where my wife went to school, so you know that it’ll always continue.”</p>

	<p>At the press conference Tuesday morning at the <span class="caps">PERFORM</span> Centre at the Loyola Campus, Donovan appeared to not be able to contain his excitement, getting greeted by fellow coaches of Stinger teams, as well as a few of his future players he’ll be coaching.</p>

 As for his predecessor, McGrath, whose 59 wins as coach will always leave a lasting mark, is quietly enjoying his retirement, while having nothing but praise for his successor.

 “[Donovan] is [a] person who truly believes in Concordia, and cares about the program. He’s a great person and great coach,” said McGrath. “I really think [Concordia] is on the right track with Mickey as the [head] coach.”

			<p><i>Concordia’s Sustainability Action Fund Sponsors University’s Green Ideas</i></p>

			<p>The greenhouse, the People’s Potato, Le Frigo Vert, the list goes on—just about anywhere you turn on Concordia’s campuses, sustainable hotspots are waiting for you to peruse. They don’t run on biofuel, however—even these green projects and others yet to be initiated need money to get started. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Enter the Sustainability Action Fund.</p>

	<p>Established in 2007 after an energizing youth summit entitled <em>Less Talk, More Action</em> and hosted by Dr. David Suzuki and former U.S. president Al Gore, the fee-levy-backed student-run organization supports and provides resources to projects at Concordia dedicated to sustainability.</p>

	<p>“We’ve funded over 150 projects in the past seven years, and we’ve given out close to half a million dollars in project funding,” said Mikayla Wujec, a Concordia geography alumnus and SAF’s chief executive officer since August of last year.</p>

	<p>“What’s really great about the fund and something that I really enjoy is that there’s a seriously crazy diversity of projects. […] It’s really neat to see all the different things that are emerging at Concordia and how successful they’ve really been.”</p>

	<p>Along with sponsoring endeavours such as Divest Concordia and biodiesel initiatives, <span class="caps">SAF</span> also has an eye on community-based, educational and social justice projects as well.</p>

	<p>“It’s funny, the majority of our projects usually fall within the social justice community and education and research categories, even more so than the energy, technology and environmental categories, which is a bit unusual because you wouldn’t necessarily think that,” Wujec said.</p>

	<p>“But especially at a university like Concordia, where there’s such amazing student presence and a really strong activism within the community, we at <span class="caps">SAF</span> and our board of directors really feel that it’s important to create these spaces to educate people on issues that affect the long-term health of any sort of community or population. So gender issues, indigenous issues, the whole spectrum of social justice is important,” she added.</p>

	<p>Cinema Politica, Alternative Libraries, <span class="caps">ASFA</span> Talks, the Sexual Assault Resource Centre and even last month’s <span class="caps">JMSB</span> <span class="caps">MBA</span> International Case Competition are among the community-based efforts that <span class="caps">SAF</span> supports.</p>

	<p>Wujec explained that while the case competition didn’t directly revolve around sustainability, the organizers behind it showed a real dedication to making the event as sustainable as possible by providing local foods, composting, ensuring competitors took shuttle buses rather than taxis and making the entire operation go paperless, which <span class="caps">SAF</span> was pleased to support.</p>
					
					
				
				
								<blockquote>
					<p>&#8220;Concordia has definitely been improving over the years; there’s a lot of hope within the university, at least from my perspective, to increase the sustainability across the board.&#8221;<br />
<em>—Mikayla Wujec, Sustainability Action Fund <span class="caps">CEO</span></em></p>
				</blockquote>
								
				
					<p><strong>Power to the Students</strong></p>

	<p>For Concordia’s overall sustainability, Wujec said Concordia has shown tangible progress but still remains far from ideal. <span class="caps">SAF</span> has embarked on a three-year in-house project called the Sustainability Curriculum Project to gather the full scope of Concordia’s sustainability situation, and compiled their initial findings last summer.</p>

	<p>“We did an audit of all the courses in the arts and science faculties to figure out how much sustainability is actually taught, which was a very rigorous project over the summer,” Wujec said. “And it turns out that just about nine per cent of courses have sustainability in them, and that’s social sustainability, environmental sustainability, economic sustainability […] so that’s a fairly low amount for a university.”</p>

	<p>Wujec went on to say that in a Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (or <span class="caps">STARS</span>) assessment, Concordia received an “F” for its curriculum.</p>

	<p>But all is not lost: <span class="caps">SAF</span> has gotten a significant amount of <span class="caps">DIY</span> sustainability projects off the ground since its inception, powered by the will of the students to help transform their school.</p>

	<p>“Concordia has definitely been improving over the years; there’s a lot of hope within the university, at least from my perspective, to increase the sustainability across the board,” Wujec said.</p>

	<p>“It’s student groups, student organizations that are really setting the tone for sustainability and making all this headway for the university. It’s starting to happen where other aspects of the university are starting to hear that and really take it to heart and understand that it’s a really important issue.”</p>

	<p>While <span class="caps">SAF</span> is most known for funding other organizations’ projects, the group also puts on events themselves, the most recent being the Winter Teaching and Learning Festival held from Feb. 5 to Feb. 7.</p>

	<p>The Festival opened with a keynote lecture by Dr. Thomas Homer-Dixon, a professor at the University of Waterloo, who Wujec says “is potentially the smartest man I’ve ever seen.”<br />
Homer-Dixon gave a stirring talk on climate change and the horror of “triage,” the brutal choices that doctors make on the battlefield to determine which of the wounded receive care and which are left to die.</p>

	<p>It’s a philosophy Homer-Dixon said could be applied to entire countries in the not-too-distant future as extreme weather events, rising temperatures and overpopulation begin to squeeze the Earth’s natural resources and carrying capacity.</p>

	<p><strong>Sustainable Campus, Sustainable World</strong></p>

	<p>For those looking to get involved with <span class="caps">SAF</span> or pitch an idea, Wujec says all are welcome to discuss grant applications and work through the process together, and internships with <span class="caps">SAF</span> are available through the sustainability minor and most recently through the geography and political science programs.</p>

	<p>“It’s a great experience for students because they get to learn about grant applications in a really supporting environment, because [our] job is to help people write a really great grant [application],” Wujec said.</p>

	<p>“So it provides some really good hands-on experience that will hopefully be useful in the future, and then if they do get funded, it provides really good project management experience, financial accounting and things you maybe necessarily don’t even learn directly in undergrad.”</p>

	<p>When asked about the future of sustainability at Concordia, Wujec had an optimistic vision.</p>

	<p>“As an institution, we’re really a microcosm of a society. We’re a huge community—40,000 people—and we have a really amazing opportunity to set the bar for what it could look like to have a sustainable society and university,” she said.</p>

	<p>“I think that <span class="caps">SAF</span> plays a really important role in that because we’re a specific place where you can come and start a project to further that goal.</p>

	<p>“It’s really important to take advantage of the possibility for project coordination, the experience, and to contribute to something that will have a really measurable impact on campus,” she continued.</p>

			<p><i>Reports Assess Concordia&#8217;s Sustainability</i></p>

			<p>At an institution as big as Concordia, in order to be truly “sustainable,” long-term efforts must come from all corners of the university.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Concordia has conducted three sustainability audits since 2003, the most recent report having been released in 2009. The next Concordia Campus Sustainability Assessment report is in the works, looking at everything from governance to construction to course content.</p>

	<p>For transportation, a draft of the forthcoming report notes that about 90 per cent of students and 80 per cent of employees are using “sustainable commuting” practices, including public transport, the shuttle bus or active transport such as cycling or walking.</p>

	<p>At Loyola, security officials use two electric cars, which are permitted to drive on the streets surrounding Loyola, to travel on campus. Loyola has two electric car charging stations for public use on the campus. </p>

	<p>The report draft, dated Jan. 30, 2014, recommends that the Concordia shuttle buses use B20 biodiesel fuel, which is 20 per cent biodiesel, compared to the two per cent biodiesel fuel mix the university currently uses. According to a 2002 Environmental Protection Agency report cited in the draft, switching to B20 fuel would reduce CO2 emissions by 12 per cent, compared to just 1.5 per cent for the B2 fuel currently in Concordia shuttle buses.</p>

	<p>However, the report notes the source of biofuel is critical to its recommendation.</p>

	<p>“Biodiesel produced from conventional food crops that could have otherwise been used as food is considered an unsustainable source,” reads the draft, noting the source of biofuel should not create competition with “animal or human food supply.”</p>

	<p>Biofuel driving up the price of food is a source of controversy for the clean energy source, in that it crowds out developing countries from growing their own crops.</p>

	<p>Another recommendation is to add an emissions surcharge for certain vehicle parking fees to encourage more use of hybrid and electric cars, and provide additional funds for shuttle and bicycle projects. Signage for Montreal’s no-idling bylaw is also recommended to be placed “throughout [Concordia]’s community.”</p>

	<p>Concordia’s newest building has qualified for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design silver rating. The Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics is the third Concordia building to receive <span class="caps">LEED</span> certification—the current standard for sustainable building.</p>

	<p>The ratings system was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, and since 2003 the Canada Green Building Council has been evaluating buildings using this ratings system. The Molson Building also has silver certification, and the <span class="caps">PERFORM</span> Centre has gold certification—the second-highest ranking after platinum.</p>

	<p>While these new buildings are getting the <span class="caps">LEED</span> seal of approval, the report draft recommends that clearly defined sustainable practices should be worked into Concordia’s Environmental Policy.</p>

	<p>The policy currently states that “green building principles” must be used for construction and renovation projects, including “optimal energy efficiency, life-cycle costs, high indoor environmental quality, and reduced water consumption.”</p>

	<p>The university also has two “green roofs” to use as garden space, however the report draft notes the roof on the MB Building is not currently being maintained.</p>

	<p>The renovations of the outside of the GM Building will reduce its natural gas consumption—which Concordia uses to heat its buildings—by 65 per cent, according to a 2011 report by Pageau Morel et Associés Inc. The D.B. Clarke Theatre also now uses <span class="caps">LED</span> light bulbs, which use less energy than the old incandescent ones. </p>

			<p><i>Montreal Bio Fuel Plant Develops Game-Changing Waste Management Technology </i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/Special/21s.terragon.flora_690_345_90.jpg" alt="" />

			<p>Engineers at Montreal-based Terragon Inc. want to change the way the world views its trash—to consider it rather, as fuel. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Their growing team has developed a machine they fondly refer to as <span class="caps">MAGS</span>, a micro auto “gasification” system that functions much like an incinerator. Garbage is fed into the machine, but eliminating trash is only half the point.</p>

	<p>“Instead of putting fuel into our system we put waste, that generates this gas, then we can combust this gas just like we would any fuel,” says Lean Lobry, an engineer at Terragon.</p>

	<p>The machine first heats the trash to temperatures as much as 700 degrees Celsius. This heating process converts most of the waste into gas, which is fed into a second chamber, where it is ignited to create energy. </p>

	<p>This energy is currently used to power the machine itself and act as a water heater.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">MAGS</span> was developed specifically for large boats and to power remote habitats like military camps or resorts, which struggle to dispose of their waste responsibly.</p>

	<p>“Waste management is a very complex process which has the perception of being a simple matter of throwing things in the garbage and a truck takes it away to the dump,” says Wayne Moore from the Department of National Defense.  </p>

	<p>“That is fine at a municipal level, but at sea it is a much different story where space is very limited, hence why <span class="caps">MAGS</span> is being considered as a potential technology suitable for shipboard use.”</p>

	<p><span class="caps">MAGS</span> is considered a green technology because for every 100 pounds of trash, it produces five pounds of non-toxic ash that can be used as fertilizer. Its emissions are filtered through a “scrubber,” which cleans the harmful components from the exhaust and can be fed back into the machine in order to create more energy.</p>

	<p>The machine has been through many phases of testing. </p>

	<p>“We tested those in the field at the Fairmont Le Château Montebello hotel, on the Maersk Laser supply ship, and we also put it with the Royal Canadian Navy and the U.S. Marines,” said Andrew Korney, communications director at Terragon. </p>

	<p>“They’ve become our biggest champions for <span class="caps">MAGS</span>. They’ve literally tested it, put everything you can imagine into it. [&#8230;] These were very successful field demonstrations.”<br />
But the machine isn’t perfect yet. It still struggles to handle moist waste, which takes longer to gassify and can stall the machine. Personnel manning the machines are therefore forced to dry their waste, sometimes in buckets on the hull of ships before feeding it into <span class="caps">MAGS</span>. </p>

	<p>Terragon is also working on developing technology to harness the energy produced to not only heat water, but convert it into electricity that could be used for other purposes. </p>

	<p>Eventually Terragon developers would like to see <span class="caps">MAGS</span> technology reach residential markets, to dispose of trash and conserve energy used for heating water in every home.</p>

	<p>“Thing is, this is such radical way of thinking for the Marine industry alone, that this will [be] a total game changer,” said Korney. </p>

	<p>Others are skeptical about the revolutionary impact <span class="caps">MAGS</span> technology could have.</p>

	<p>“I think it’s a neat technological development; it seems that it is able to treat the trash in a way with having emissions that are within standards, which is good,” said Faisal Shennib, environmental coordinator at Concordia. </p>

	<p>He considers <span class="caps">MAGS</span> as more of a band-aid solution to waste management problems that need to be addressed from the source.</p>

	<p>Through his research on better waste reduction strategies for Concordia, Shennib has concluded that rather than creating so much waste, producers and consumers of goods need to be more mindful of the kind and amount of packaging is being created to contain and ship what we consume. </p>

	<p>He explains his attitude towards waste management with an analogy.</p>

	<p>“You’re standing near a river and you see a baby in the water, and you’re alarmed that there’s a baby in the water, it’s drowning, it’s crying. You go to rescue the baby, and then babies just keep coming,” he said.</p>

			<p>When experts from around the country arrived at McGill University on Feb. 7 for a conference on oil, energy and Canada’s future, they found the doors were locked.</p>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p>Masked anti-capitalist protesters had fastened shut the front doors and barred the fire exits. The McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, which organized the conference, moved the event to another location until the so-called “lockout” ended quietly a couple of hours later.</p>

	<p>On university campuses around the world, most students have found a different way to take a stand against fossil fuels and climate change. Instead of staging protests like the lockout, they have taken aim at universities’ investment portfolios.</p>

	<p>“In general, we [at Divest McGill] tend to think of strategies that will serve to build support on campus, as well as increase the visibility of this support to key decision makers at the university,” said Divest McGill member Kristen Perry.</p>

	<p>McGill’s divest group is not alone. There are campaigns across the globe, including one at Concordia, to encourage universities to divest their holdings from fossil fuel companies and reinvest in greener alternatives. Divest campaigns have sprung up on 18 Canadian campuses, over 300 in the U.S., and a handful of others in the rest of the world.</p>

	<p>Advocates of divestment say it’s wrong for universities to profit from shares in the worst carbon-emitting corporations. Student-led divest groups are hoping their campaigns will hurt the fossil fuel industry as past divestment movements undermined apartheid in the ‘80s and big tobacco in the ‘90s.</p>

	<p>So far, the U.S. divestment movement has had mixed success. Nine American colleges have agreed to divest. However, Harvard University, which has the biggest endowment fund in the country totaling around US$32.7 billion, has refused. </p>

	<p>No Canadian university has pledged to go fossil-free.</p>

	<p><strong>Concordia and McGill</strong></p>

	<p>That comes as little surprise to Anthony Garoufalis-Auger of Divest Concordia.</p>

	<p>“There’s not as much openness to divestment here as there is in the U.S.,” he said. “[Canadian universities] are more rigid in the way they operate.”</p>

	<p>He added that it would be “hard to imagine” Concordia following the example of colleges in the U.S. that agreed to divest, such as Unity College in Maine. The first fossil-free American university, Unity reported last May that it lost no money from its decision to divest its $14.5-million fund.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Divestment is one of the only campaigns in the modern climate movement focused on true systemic change.&#8221;<br />
<em>—Chloe Maxmin, Divest Harvard</em></p>
				</blockquote>
								
				
					<p>“We don’t have the same kind of activism in our [Canadian university] administrations,” Garoufalis-Auger said.</p>

	<p>Divest Concordia has still managed to persuade the university to rethink its investment practices. In January, student reps sat down with board members of the Concordia University Foundation—the university’s $136.6 million endowment fund—and the university treasurer to plan an <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/5192">ethically responsible investment policy</a>.</p>

	<p>The policy is still in the very early stages, but Divest Concordia is hoping the university will soon start screening companies based on their environmental track record.</p>

	<p>“We are dealing with complex issues that require a lot of discussion and exchange,” said university spokesperson Chris Mota.</p>

	<p>The push for divestment has received the support of the Concordia Student Union, which officially endorsed Divest Concordia in September.</p>

	<p>At McGill, student efforts for divestment have run up against a wall. In February 2013, they submitted two petitions with 750 signatures each to the Board of Governors to divest from fossil fuels, oil sands and the Plan Nord, but they were rejected.</p>

	<p>In years past, McGill has divested from tobacco and Burmese businesses. But the McGill Board said the university relies on its fossil fuel investments and that it doesn’t meet the board’s standards for divestment based on “social injury.”</p>

	<p>“Whether you like it or not, Canada is a resource-based economy,” board member Michael Boychuck told <em>The McGill Daily</em>. “That’s a fact. It’s not going to change any time soon.”</p>

	<p>Divest McGill isn’t taking no for an answer.</p>

	<p>“Through proving the failure of the ‘official’ process we can justify beginning to escalate our campaigns and start putting strategic pressures on other change-making avenues in the university,” said Divest McGill member Kristen Perry.</p>

	<p>Although not involved in the lockout of the Faculty Club during the oil conference on Feb. 7, Divest McGill—and its counterpart at Concordia—supported the protesters. </p>

	<p>The Divest McGill campaign has been endorsed by three major student societies representing 30,000 students.</p>

	<p>“It’s definitely progressing,” said Amina Moustaqim-Barette, a member of Divest McGill. “As we get more info about alternative investments and more support on campus, the idea is becoming more popular with the administration as well.”</p>

	<p><strong>Divesting Harvard</strong></p>

	<p>If American colleges have generally been more open to divestment, Harvard is an exception.</p>

	<p>Members of Divest Harvard estimate that the university has invested US$32.6 million in the top 200 fossil fuel companies.</p>

	<p>In November 2012, 72 per cent of undergrads voted in favour of divestiture. Harvard President Drew Faust responded with an open letter: “I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise.”</p>

	<p>“The endowment is a resource,” she continued, “not an instrument to impel social or political change.”</p>

	<p>Divest Harvard disagrees. Coordinator of the group, Chloe Maxmin, says “divestment is one of the only campaigns in the modern climate movement focused on true systemic change.”</p>

	<p>“Divestment is important because it is bypassing a government that is inefficient and clogged by the power of the fossil fuel lobby,” she wrote in an email to <em>The Link</em>. </p>

	<p>“It’s going straight to the source of carbon extraction and political gridlock: the fossil fuel industry.”</p>

	<p><em>Update: The Link originally reported that the McGill oil conference, &#8220;Petroculture 2014,&#8221; took place on Feb. 8. In fact, the conference was held Feb. 6 and 7. The Link regrets the error.</em></p>

			<p><i>Studying, Growing and Learning in Concordia’s Greenhouse</i></p>

			<h3>As university students, sunlight is hard to come by this time of year. The sun rising earlier and setting later now than during the summer months is worsened by the fact that we’re trapped indoors during daylight hours due to school and perhaps work. </h3>
			
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				

				
					<p><br />

From December to March, we ditch reading on the balcony for the flourescent lights of our school library and wilt like starved flowers into the wee morning hours. This is the time for the Hall Building’s oasis—which may sound like an oxymoron—to flourish.</p>

	<p>“[There’s] fresh air, you know, with all these trees and sunlight so you don’t get Seasonal Affective Disorder, and [there’s] mad vitamin D […] and people can be very friendly so the atmosphere is very good,” said Concordia greenhouse social events coordinator Sheena Swirlz.</p>

	<p>The greenhouse on the Hall Building rooftop is known for its inviting study space, but also has its roots in a number of urban and market gardening efforts across the city, benefiting the likes of local schools and food co-ops like the People’s Potato and Le Frigo Vert.</p>

	<p>One of the literal ways the greenhouse does that is with its seeding project, where its members and interns meticulously watch and help grow 10,000 vegetable seeds during their very early stages. They then distribute the sprouts to community organizations for people to continue to grow and eventually eat.</p>

	<p>“It starts as this tiny box of seeds that come in the mail and ends up with a plant on every single surface of the greenhouse and then I don’t see them again, but […] then they grow up and they produce food for people,” said greenhouse collective coordinator Jackie Martin.</p>

	<p>In 2006, weighed down by maintenance costs and a mold problem, the greenhouse was to be torn down. But students involved in Sustainable Concordia and the Geography Department urged the university to salvage the space, and the glass structure atop the Hall Building survived, as well as everything inside it.</p>

	<p>Sustainable Concordia went on to separate the space into two areas: one for growing plants, including fruits like papaya, vegetables and micro greens; the other, an area for socializing.</p>

	<p>The space is composed of two of the many adjacent glass rooms that make up the structure. Plants shading and surrounding the seating area are nourished by sunlight pouring through the glass walls and ceiling. </p>

	<p>On Mondays and Fridays, students can book the social space in the greenhouse from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for events or gatherings like club meetings, dinner parties and film screenings. So at night, during one of their “5 à 7,” those plants may be entwined with lights that follow the backdrop of the city’s skyline.</p>

	<p>“It’s just a really nice, beautiful space that you can use for yourself,” says Martin.</p>

	<p><strong>Farming in the City</strong></p>

	<p>Since gaining its 12-cent student fee levy and becoming its own collective last spring, the Hall Building’s greenhouse has initiated a number of new endeavours, including an increase in its weekly events and workshops. </p>

	<p>The fee levy constitutes the group’s main revenue stream and amounts to about $75,000 a year. Before, it relied on grants and a five-cent levy as part of Sustainable Concordia.</p>

	<p>Other revenue includes its City Farm School internships, which cost $450, but help cover “two workshops, as well as the training you will receive from the <span class="caps">CFS</span> coordinators,” according to the <span class="caps">CFS</span> website.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CFS</span> is “an initiative to develop partnerships and expertise in urban agriculture on the island of Montreal,” according to its website. It fulfills its mission by working with the English Montreal School Board, building gardens in their school yards and hosting before and after-school workshop teaching students basic urban gardening skills.</p>

	<p>“One of the goals of these school yard gardens is to help build the students’ confidence and give them the opportunity to make a difference in their schools and in their own lives,” said school yard gardens coordinator Marcus Lobb at this year’s <span class="caps">CFS</span> launch on Thursday.</p>

	<p>Part of the project includes the Loyola City Farm, a vegetable garden at the Loyola campus. The farm is being expanded in the upcoming growing season with a 70- by 100-foot plot “which will double what he have right now,” announced Martin at the Thursday launch. </p>

	<p>The new plot will allow the city farm to grow all of the People’s Potato’s garlic, ridding them of the need to buy garlic from outside Canada. </p>

	<p>Also part of the collective’s initiatives is a series of workshops held every second Thursday, which range from building “living necklaces” made of plants, to moss grafitti, to zine-making, to mushroom growing.</p>

	<p>“People always have a lot to contribute to every workshop,” said Swirlz, citing the mushroom growing workshop as an example with people bringing their own tricks to the table.</p>

	<p>Swirlz is one of the collective’s five part-time staff members. The two other staff members work full-time.</p>

	<p>In the growing section of the greenhouse, in the winter, the greenhouse’s members grow microgreens—small trendy leaf vegetables used to enhance a meal’s look and taste—as well as salad greens, beans and house plants, which are sold at the popular house plant sale every year. Then, there are the perennials—plants that live over two years—of the greenhouse’s tea atrium. </p>

	<p>“It’s so about the community aspect, it’s not closed-off, it’s not about the production or the money-making factor—we serve the community and get people involved,” said Swirlz.</p>

	<p><em>Have you seen our <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/blogs/entry/4901">Link Live Session</a> in the Concordia greenhouse? Watch the Montreal folk trio Street Meat play &#8220;Le Mésadapté&#8221; among the greenery.</em></p>

			<p><i>Why Divestment Is Necessary for Concordia to Flourish</i></p>

			<p>Divestment. It’s the talk of the town, the word on the street. It’s the subject of workshops, the screen print on gym shirts, and the latest petition making the rounds. What’s all the fuss about this newest addition to our vocabulary?</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>We’ve all heard the word “investment,” which means to place a known amount of money, time or other valuables into a situation, wait and receive greater returns than what you put in.</p>

	<p>One can quantify some investments, such as stocks in a company, while other investments, such as time spent with a loved one, enter the realm of the unquantifiable.</p>

	<p>Out of all kinds of investments, however, financial investments are perhaps those that can have the greatest impact on our collective well-being. This runs the gamut from the goods we buy, to the services we provide, to the companies we invest in.</p>

	<p>Needing large amounts of capital in order to run factories and pay labourers, the vast majority of large corporations are publicly traded. If a publicly traded company makes a profit, investors who own shares of the company may receive a portion of its profits in the form of dividends, provided that the company chooses not to reinvest all of the profits in its own expansion instead.</p>

	<p>In addition, if the company is doing well, its shares will likely increase in value on the stock market. These are the financial incentives to invest in profitable industries.<br />
But what does this have to do with Concordia? According to a 2011 financial audit, Concordia University has investments worth over $100 million. And this publicly available audit also indicates that nearly $12 million of that $100 million was invested in various oil, gas and pipeline companies.</p>

	<p>It’s understandable why Concordia University invests in fossil fuel companies: As the bedrock of our globalized industrial economy, fossil fuel companies are among the most profitable on the planet.</p>

	<p>We use fossil fuels in every aspect of modern life, from the growing of food through personal transportation to the manufacturing of practically everything. Thus the power and influence of fossil fuels companies such as BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil and TransCanada are not to be underestimated. In purely financial terms, investing in fossil fuels is a wise decision.</p>

	<p>Now, descending from the abstract realm of neoliberal economic doctrine, let us take a hard look at the reality on the ground. First off, climate change is happening. Every year, the Arctic ice sheet grows smaller in area. Global average temperatures break records set the year before.</p>

	<p>On every coastline, the sea level creeps up, centimetre by centimetre. The number of species falls as forests catch fire, deserts claim the grasslands and rivers run dry. This is happening as we speak.</p>

	<p>According to the fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, there is a 95 per cent certainty that humans are the cause of most of the global warming observed since the 1950s.</p>

	<p>The report lists the burning of fossil fuels as the primary contributor. It adds that tropical deforestation is the second-biggest contributor, as we cut down the forests that render the air breathable on this planet. If we are to preserve the livability of our birthplace, the only home we have, then we must replant the forests and stop burning fossil fuels as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p>This is where divestment comes in. Divest Concordia, a student-run environmental justice group, is spearheading the campaign to have Concordia University divest—the antithesis to invest—any and all holdings in fossil fuel industries, working to persuade the university’s administration to pull its money out of polluting industries and reinvest in emerging technologies.</p>

	<p>Divest Concordia aims to achieve this by convincing the university to form a Committee for Responsible Investment. This committee would oversee the divestment from fossil fuels and reallocation of funds to clean energy companies.</p>

	<p>This shift in capital is vital if we are to maintain our modern technologies while developing a low-carbon energy economy.</p>

	<p>To me, continued fossil fuel development is an act of madness, plain and simple. To invest in companies perpetrating fossil fuel development is to be an accomplice in a great crime, one that history will judge harshly. Considering the present state of our planet Earth, with climate change already devastating populations around the globe, to divest from fossil fuels is the only logical choice.</p>

	<p>Yet even higher than reason, higher than logic, is the love for my family and friends, for the children I hope to have, for all the living beings that share our Earth. We have a moral responsibility to act now, for the gravity of our situation demands nothing less.</p>

			<h3>A panel of government officials, journalists and activists debated government transparency and the right to information Feb. 4 at Concordia’s Samuel Bronfman House. </h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

&#8220;The failure of federal and provincial government to move toward greater access to information is born from [a disagreeing] attitude of mind,” said Concordia journalism professor Alan Conter to an audience of about 40 people. </p>

	<p>“What guides the thinking is an attitude of mind rather than a set of written rules,” continued the media law and ethics professor. “The commissioners generally want greater improvements, yet are powerless to draft new legislation.” </p>

	<p>The panel was organized by Concordia’s School of Community and Public Affairs to discuss the public’s access to information from the government.</p>

	<p>Quebec’s Access to Information Act was voted into law in 1982, and since then all other provinces and territories have adopted similar <span class="caps">ATI</span> legislation. </p>

	<p>Since its inception on the national level, the Supreme Court of Canada has declared freedom to information to be a fundamental part of one’s right to freedom of expression, protecting it under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>

	<p>Under federal law, the right to information is balanced with an individual’s right to privacy and each request is examined on a case-by-case basis.</p>

	<p>Yet, with 30 years having passed and the state of collection and distribution of information having shifted so radically in the wake of widely available information on the Internet, there have been calls in recent years to renew and strengthen <span class="caps">ATI</span> legislation.</p>

	<p>According to Conter, the calls from journalists and advocacy groups to reform the legislation have been steadily increasing over the past few years.</p>

	<p>Teresa Carluccio, administrative judge for the Commission d’accès à l’information du Québec—the provincial access to information tribunal—says that every year there are over 1,000 applications made to the Commission alone.</p>

	<p>She says that according to the law, every person in Quebec has the right to demand the government for public documents, regardless of citizenship status.</p>

	<p>Public documents are defined as any piece of information, whether words, sound or images, that have been created, collected and stored by the Quebec government. </p>

	<p>But Jonathan Brun, co-founder of Montreal Ouvert, a citizen’s action group that has successfully lobbied the Montreal city government to launch an open-data policy, says the inflexibility of the current legislation hinders the citizenry from being informed.</p>

	<p>Also, since the provincial <span class="caps">ATI</span> legislation has largely remained unchanged since 1982, Brun asserts the laws need to be revamped in order to get them in line with the pillars of the digital age: open and shared information routed across the World Wide Web. </p>

	<p>But Mike de Souza, a reporter specializing in energy, environment and infrastructure issues who was laid off by Postmedia News as a national political correspondent the day before the panel event, says the web hasn’t entirely changed things for the better. </p>

	<p>“In the past, if you asked an official a hard question, they would be pressured to answer on the spot,” he said. “With the Internet, one can now reply, ‘Can you send that to me in an e-mail?’ </p>

	<p>“In this way more questions from journalists are ignored.”</p>

	<p>According to De Souza, from the federal government’s sanctioning of the tar sands, to climate change and the factors leading up to the Lac-Mégantic distaster, <span class="caps">ATI</span> requests were able to shed light on the real truth. </p>

	<p>“We wanted to know: What happened at Lac-Mégantic? Through the <span class="caps">ATI</span>, we found that there was a directive in certain departments to ignore access to information requests, recommending to focus on other issues.”</p>

	<p>However, De Souza echoed other panellists in calling for updates to <span class="caps">ATI</span> legislation, explaining that often even when requested under <span class="caps">ATI</span> the truth is still easily concealable under the current legal framework.</p>

	<p>“Typically, when the government doesn’t wish to reveal something, they say that the matters are ‘under consultation’ or a matter of national security,” he said.</p>

			<p><i>Analyzing the Spread of the Suburbs in Montreal</i></p>

			<h3>For Lissa Marcotte, there’s truth in the marketing slogan “<em>La vie est belle à Mirabel</em>.” In this suburban municipality on the northern periphery of the Montreal metropolitan region, where suburban comfort meets the tranquility of farm country, life is good.</h3>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p><br />

“We like the neighbourhood very much,” said the social worker and mother of three boys aged 7, 5 and 2. “Families know each other. Between neighbours, we’ll help each other. [&#8230;] There are also a lot of children. There’s lots of parks with playgrounds and skating rinks, they’re well-maintained.”</p>

	<p>Mirabel has grown considerably in recent years. The last Canadian census found that its population increased by no less than 21.2 per cent between 2006 and 2011.</p>

	<p>“There are two schools that are at full capacity and there’s talk for next year of building a third school,” said Marcotte, who has lived in the suburban municipality for 12 years and has seen the influx of families profoundly transform the area. “It’s truly an economic boom.”</p>

	<p>But not everything in the suburbs is as rosy as it seems. The suburbs are not nearly as environmentally friendly as their lush, green lawns may lead the unsuspecting city-dweller to believe.</p>

	<p><strong>Understanding the Phenomenon</strong></p>

	<p>Canada is most accurately described as a suburban nation, according to a study published in the Journal of Architectural and Planning Research last fall.</p>

	<p>In “Suburban Nation? Estimating the Size of Canada’s Suburban Population,” Queen’s University urban planning professor David Gordon and policy analyst Mark Janzen found that suburban areas accounted for roughly 80 per cent of the country’s metropolitan population and around 66 per cent of the national population in 2006.</p>

	<p>Montreal is no exception. Data provided by Gordon to <em>The Link</em> shows that 76 per cent of the metropolitan region’s residents lived in car-dependent suburban areas within Montreal or neighbouring suburban municipalities in 2011.</p>

	<p>It wasn’t always that way. </p>

	<p>“The urban sprawl in both metropolitan areas—in Quebec City and Montreal—increased sharply from 1951 to now, and the sharpest increase happened in the past 30 years, between 1986 and now,” said Naghmeh Nazarnia, who recently completed her master’s thesis on urban sprawl at Concordia. </p>

	<p>“The results [of my research] show that the degree of sprawl in the Montreal metropolitan area increased 11-fold.”</p>

	<p><strong>The Environmental Impact</strong></p>

	<p>For McGill University urban planning professor Raphaël Fischler, it’s important to acknowledge that urban sprawl has enabled many people to achieve the dream of a home of their own.</p>

	<p>“What people generally negatively call urban sprawl has in fact been an incredible contribution to the middle class in terms of giving the middle class access to single-family housing,” Fischler said. “The middle class cannot afford a single-family house or a semi-detached house, something with a yard and of a decent size, inside the city.”</p>

	<p>Still, all of this residential development on the edges of the metropolitan region has its disadvantages.</p>

	<p>“The environmental reputation of suburbs is a bad one, and it’s deservedly so,” Fischler said. “They are clearly not a gift to the Earth in terms of [their] carbon footprint.”</p>

	<p>In some parts of the metropolitan region, suburban development has undercut rich ecosystems such as wetlands, destroying natural habitats—a definite “no-no,” according to Fischler. </p>

	<p>Fischler adds that the energy consumption of suburbanites is also higher than that of city-dwellers. </p>

	<p>“If you have a single-family home, it takes more energy to heat than a condominium, because it has four walls and a roof exposed to the elements,” he said. </p>

	<p>That may one day change, however. </p>

	<p>“If solar energy, wind energy and other forms of alternative energy become [more viable], it may be that every home in the suburbs can become energy-independent and everyone will drive cars that are using renewable energy, and this question [of sustainability] will become moot,” he continued.  </p>

	<p>“However, at this point [in time], when we still rely on a lot of fossil fuels, it is clear that cities have a lower carbon footprint than suburbs and that suburbs involve more energy expenditures per [housing] unit.” </p>

	<p><strong>Curbing the Sprawl</strong></p>

	<p>Though he doesn’t dismiss land use policies entirely—he is an urban planner by profession, after all—Fischler argues that the Montreal metropolitan region’s carbon footprint can be reduced more easily through technological innovation than through better metropolitan planning.</p>

	<p>For instance, he said increasing the fuel efficiency of cars by 50 per cent would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving a similar reduction in the region’s carbon footprint through planning tools would require 50 per cent of the individuals living in single-family homes to move into more energy-efficient condos or apartments—something that would be considerably more difficult to bring about.</p>

	<p>But even if technological progress might be a shortcut to environmental sustainability, Fischler said there are other reasons to curb urban sprawl, including the fact that cities promote greater inter-generational and social equity.</p>

	<p>“In the suburbs, I think the question of car dependency has a tremendous impact, and that’s not a technological question,” he said. “That’s a question of the fact that under 18 and over a certain age if you become less physically fit, you cannot drive.</p>

	<p>“It’s possible that, in the future, automated vehicles <em>à la</em> Google will solve that problem and that any youngster of 12 and any elderly person of 92 can hop in a self-driving electric vehicle, but for the moment, the suburb is not a very equitable place in many cases for poor people, for the elderly and for the young.”</p>

	<p>Reducing the amount of urban sprawl may also help to protect the forests and farms left in Greater Montreal.</p>

	<p>Progress is being made, according to Fischler, who says suburban municipalities are increasingly taking public transit into account in their development plans, seeking to build denser neighbourhoods around transit hubs.</p>

	<p>As for the environment, Claude Marois, a geography professor at the Université de Montréal, says the laws already in place to protect agricultural lands in the metropolitan region are working, and that he’s also noticed a shift in the mentality of suburban municipalities on the importance of conserving agricultural areas and forests.</p>

	<p>“Despite all the urban pressures, agriculture is continuing relatively well,” Marois said. “Since the 1990s, more and more municipalities are realizing that the protection of the environment becomes a factor in enhancing their attractiveness to residents, that quality of life and improvement of the environment go together.”</p>

			<p><i>Residents Complain of Unfinished Rooms and Unresponsive Management</i></p>

			<p>When Gabriella Wilsker was looking for a place to live for her first year of university, St. Cathy’s student residence seemed like the perfect solution. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Wilsker was moving from Boston, and the community living described on the private residence’s website sounded like a good fit for someone with no connections in Montreal. It was located across the street from Concordia’s EV Building, where she would start classes in September 2013. It came furnished, with Internet, air conditioning and a TV in each room.</p>

	<p>Wilsker stayed at St. Cathy’s throughout the summer, later deciding to move into a new section of the residence slated for completion for the beginning of September.  </p>

	<p>When she was moving into her new room for September however, Wilsker said it was covered in dust. It also did not yet have the couch and two desks that were supposed to be included in the room.</p>

	<p>The day before dozens of students were meant to move in, Wilsker and the building’s residence assistants worked to finish the dorms.</p>

	<p>“They had us moving in last-minute items to the rooms. One kid didn’t have a bed for two nights. None of the rooms with working cable had TVs, which they were all supposed to have,” she said, adding that she moved furniture and set up rooms for 12 hours without pay.</p>

	<p>Wilsker says she was also charged $20 for her floor to be mopped. </p>

	<p>By the end of the first week of classes, Wilsker was evicted along with a resident’s assistant that she had recommended for the job.</p>

	<p>Having not yet signed her lease for the coming semester, Wilsker says she was evicted because she wouldn’t keep her mouth shut about the residence not living up to what was advertised.</p>

	<p>“They were telling my parents that I was unmanageable, that I was rude, that all the RAs were complaining about me, which was false,” said Wilsker, adding that she was no longer allowed on site because the management said she smoked marijuana.</p>

	<p>“They wanted to meet with me in person and have me sign something to say I wouldn’t pursue any legal action,” said Wilsker, noting that an RA tried multiple times to get her to sign the agreement, which she refused.</p>

	<p>Chris Chapin was also evicted from St. Cathy’s, according to Wilsker, for complaining to management about the state of the residence during the first week of September.</p>

	<p>Chapin declined to comment, as he is pursuing legal action against the management of St. Cathy’s.<br />
“He was accepted at the residence, they cashed in the cheque, and for reasons unknown to us they decided to unilaterally evict him without even going to the rental board,” said Angelo Caputo, the lawyer who is representing Chapin.</p>

	<p>“I did get a mandate from Mr. Chapin that he wants to take legal action against them for all the damage and inconvenience that was caused in that incident.”</p>

	<p>Wilsker also plans on taking legal action against the residence’s owners.</p>

	<p>In an email sent to <em>The Link</em> by Amanda Kemal, director of operations at <span class="caps">UNO</span> Investments Inc.—the company that manages St. Cathy’s—wrote that the building “had as many as 50 parents move in their children on day one, and not one of them had an issue with the cleanliness.”</p>

	<p>However, a current tenant of St. Cathy’s agrees with Wilsker’s account of the move-in.</p>

	<p>“My room was disgusting. Me and my mom had to go get mops and clean up my room. There was dust everywhere, I couldn’t sleep because of the dust,” said one tenant, Sara*. </p>

	<p>“I don’t think people wanted to leave, because they knew how tricky it would be to find a new place. We just wanted reimbursement for one month’s rent. People were really ticked off about construction,” she said, adding that the construction of the building’s exterior continued into October, starting as early as 7 a.m.</p>

	<p>“At the beginning it was really ridiculous. They weren’t ready at all.” </p>

	<p><strong>A Market of Their Own</strong></p>

	<p>The Concordia Student Union Housing and Job Bank is familiar with St. Cathy’s residence.</p>

	<p>“[Students] can’t reach anyone who has any ability to deal with their problems. The RAs who are students living there take their complaints, but the management doesn’t get back to people,” said Leanne Ashworth, a coordinator at HoJo. </p>


					
					
				
				
								<blockquote>
					<p>“My room was disgusting. Me and my mom had to go get mops and clean up my room. There was dust everywhere, I couldn’t sleep because of the dust.&#8221;<br />
<em>—A current tenant of St. Cathy&#8217;s</em></p>
				</blockquote>
								
				
					<p>Ashworth says HoJo has been getting complaints about the space for the last few years, but that there was a spike of complaints in September. They do not recommend the residence to students.</p>

	<p>“The style of management is ‘ignore the students, take their money.’ They take their credit card information online so there’s really no reason for them to communicate with the students for the rest of the year,” she said.</p>

	<p>“It was stupid hot, it would be about 30 degrees in my room. They didn’t want me to leave my door open, and even with my window open it would be ridiculous,” said Sara, adding that many residents did not have curtains for their windows, and that construction workers could see inside their bedrooms.</p>

	<p>Internet quality continues to be an issue, and each tenant is now limited to 10 GB of bandwidth each month—although that was not communicated before signing.</p>

	<p>“They’d be like ‘yeah we’ll fix it, we’ll fix it,’ and they’d never get to it,” Sara said.</p>

	<p>The students in St. Cathy’s took their complaints to the RAs, who receive a discount on their rent as payment. The RAs would then inform Kamel.</p>

	<p>“We deal directly with Amanda,” said St. Cathy’s RA Ali Murji, noting that a receptionist at the building is also able to take complaints. He said there was some delay with furniture in the rooms for September, but when someone asked it was dealt with right away.</p>

	<p>Ashworth recommended sending a registered petition to the company, demanding a full month’s rent in damages for the noise and unfinished rooms. The petition, complete with 53 resident signatures, was mailed at the beginning of October.</p>

	<p>The petition was delivered, but residence management gave no response. Kamel, who manages the residence, says this is because the petition included false information, and that residents did not know what they were signing.</p>

	<p>They then brought the petition to the Régie du logement du Québec, the provincial rental board, but were told that complaints would need to be filed individually.</p>

	<p>“It’s an open secret that the Régie du logement wait time is 17 months for non-urgent issues,” said Ashworth. </p>

	<p>She added that as long as there is “minimal livability” in the space, the request is considered non-urgent—stating that, for example, having hot water shut off would not count as urgent.</p>

	<p>With the recent surge in private residences in downtown Montreal, Ashworth says this kind of housing is particularly attractive to international students, who are looking for furnished spaces with a lease shorter than the typical 12 months required for apartments. </p>

	<p>However, these students are less likely to be aware of tenant rights in Montreal. There is also not enough room in Concordia’s residences to fit all first-year students, with a lottery system in place for those looking to live there.</p>

	<p>St. Cathy’s offers four and eight-month leases in addition to the more common 12-month agreements. Rent at the residence ranges from $695 to $950 per month.  </p>

	<p>“These large student buildings, they’ll offer heat included and Internet included but that needs to work all the time,” said Ashworth. “That’s not a gift, that’s included in their rent. It’s something people could go to the Régie for, but it would take two years.”</p>

	<p>Kamel stated that the new residences would have been completed by September if not for the two-week construction strike at the end of June 2013.</p>

	<p>However, this isn’t the first time the residence has had complaints of construction occurring while tenants are living in the building.</p>

	<p>One tenant who lived at St. Cathy’s from the fall of 2012 to the spring of 2013 echoed the complaints of construction and dust as early as September 2012. They also noted that there were holes in the wall. “They appeared when the adjacent building was torn down,” said the former tenant, who did not want to be named.</p>

	<p>She also said tenants were required to provide post-dated cheques and a key deposit, both of which are illegal in Quebec, and that tenants were pressured to sign non-disclosure agreements in exchange for $250.</p>

	<p>The former tenant planned on reporting the issues, but was unable to get a hearing date with the Régie while she still lived at the residence. </p>

	<p>“I was filing with another tenant and she moved to Toronto. Things got a bit complicated after that,” she said. “We weren’t quite sure how to follow through.” </p>

			<h3>Justin Trudeau is already courting the youth vote ahead of the 2015 federal election, and he believes changing the nature of the conversation in Ottawa is integral to re-engaging younger Canadians in politics.</h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

The leader of the federal Liberal Party continued his tour of Canadian campuses last Thursday with stops at three Montreal universities, starting his day at his alma matter, McGill, before going on to visit the Université de Montréal and Concordia.</p>

	<p>“This [university tour] is […] about how important it is to view politics as a dialogue, as a conversation that we can all be part of, that we need to contribute to with our voices, with our actions, with our participation,” Trudeau told the crowded D.B. Clarke Theatre, insisting that his intention with the university tour wasn’t to attempt to persuade younger voters to join the Liberal Party or vote for its candidates, but rather to engage university students in a discussion about politics.</p>

	<p>“Because politics is […] more focused on winning than on serving, more focused on finding the right wedge issues in order to get elected than focused on bringing people together to actually solve the challenges we’re facing,” he said. </p>

	<p>“For me, I truly believe that politics needs to be about a respectful exchange of ideas, based on facts, seeking always for common ground, common values, common goals and shared dreams.” </p>

	<p>Trudeau said we are in the midst of “a wave of citizen engagement” and that younger Canadians in particular are better informed and more engaged in advocacy than ever before. </p>

	<p>Still, that engagement hasn’t translated into participation at the ballot box. Trudeau noted that only about 30 per cent of younger Canadians exercise their right to vote.</p>

	<p>“Getting young people to choose to vote and get involved isn’t just about getting a few more people who are unlikely to vote for Mr. Harper to the ballot box. That’s just a pleasant byproduct,” he said.</p>

	<p>“What it really is about is changing the nature of conversations that happen in Ottawa and in government.”</p>

	<p>According to Trudeau, the low participation rate of younger voters is related to the fact that they find it hard to relate to the topics and government policies discussed in Parliament.</p>

	<p>“Right now, much of government is consumed with focusing on healthcare, on pensions, on tough-on-crime measures,” he said. “Why? Because those [topics] play well to the people who vote—seniors, who [have] close to 80 per cent turnout.”</p>

	<p>Trudeau said the government doesn’t spend much time, if any, talking about education, youth employment and other long-term issues that are of concern to younger generations.</p>

	<p>He mentioned how profoundly different the House of Commons would look if only young electors aged 18 to 25 had been counted in the last federal election.</p>

	<p>“Parliament today would have 43 Green Party MPs and the Conservatives wouldn’t be in government, they’d be the third party,” he said. </p>

	<p><strong>Question Period</strong></p>

	<p>Following his speech, Trudeau took several audience members’ questions. Asked what his stance is on the controversial Bill 60, also known as the Quebec Charter of Values, Trudeau said he met with Premier Pauline Marois and expressed his concerns about it. </p>

	<p>“It is an unhelpful direction to be taking, to try and make people choose between their religious beliefs and their jobs,” he said.  </p>

	<p>“Has this leadership by our premier led to solving a problem, led to bringing people together to try and figure out an issue that is top-of-mind for people? No,” he continued. “It’s led to divisiveness and polarization around a problem that, quite frankly, they couldn’t even demonstrate was a problem.</p>

	<p>“This bill is about one thing and one thing only, about identity politics.”</p>

	<p>Trudeau was also asked about Internet privacy and recent revelations of multiple governments collecting large amounts of data on their citizens. He said governments have gotten carried away with intelligence gathering.</p>

	<p>“One of the things that I’ve been calling for, and the Liberal Party has been calling for, is a much more robust system of oversight over our security and intelligence agencies,” Trudeau said.</p>

	<p>He added that there needs to be a conversation on why citizens feel comfortable sharing vast amounts of information about themselves with corporations like Facebook but not with their government. </p>

	<p>Asked about the development of the tar sands, Trudeau said he wants to develop them while also protecting the environment. </p>

	<p>“Canada absolutely needs to do a lot more in terms of living up to its responsibilities as a modern country, as a good global citizen, to reduce the impact that we have on climate change,” he said. “We have to figure out how to make what’s good for the economy and what’s good for the environment go together.” </p>

	<p>In answering a question about federal funding cuts to arts and culture, Trudeau made a reference to Winston Churchill during the Second World War, when he was the prime minister of the United Kingdom and needed money to help finance the war.  </p>

	<p>“Churchill was sitting around in his war cabinet, and they were talking about cuts to various departments and ministries,” said Trudeau. “And they were going down the line: ‘health we’ll have to cut 10 per cent, roads we’ll have to cut 20 per cent.’ And then they got down to the ministry of culture.</p>

	<p>“And the prime minister said, ‘We cut zero from the ministry of culture. […] If not, what are we fighting for, if not our culture?’” </p>

	<p>Trudeau said he plans to reverse the cuts to arts and culture funding if his party comes to power.</p>

	<p>Finally, on reforms to Canada’s electoral system, Trudeau said he would like to put in place a preferential voting system.</p>

	<p>Under such a system, Canadians would rank the candidates on the ballot in order of preference. If no candidate is chosen by over 50 per cent of voters as their first choice, then voters’ second-choice and third-choice votes will be tabulated.</p>

	<p>“Political parties would then work to be the second or third choices of more voters,” Trudeau said. “Common values will be more important than differences.”</p>

			<p><i>Student Conference Concordia Transitions Discusses Ways to Improve Concordia’s Food System </i></p>

			<h3>Members of the Concordia Food Coalition, the Concordia Greenhouse and the Concordia Student Union agree: Concordia needs a new food system, one centred not on financial profits, but rather on being committed to providing affordable and healthy food. The only question is: how to make it possible? </h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

That’s what the student groups set out to determine at a conference they organized on Saturday titled Concordia Transitions. </p>

	<p>“I just think it’s really fantastic to see students working together on a [conference] like this,” said former <span class="caps">CSU</span> president Lex Gill, who facilitated the discussion at the conference alongside Erik Chevrier, who the <span class="caps">CSU</span> hired in October as a researcher and negotiator. </p>

	<p>“Concordia has a really long history of rich, imaginative campus activism, and I feel like the work around food systems and sustainability that’s been going on over the last year or two in particular has been really good.”</p>

	<p>The conference began and ended with urban agriculture. Curtis Stone, a farmer who founded Green City Acres in Kelowna, B.C., got the event started with a keynote speech. He explained how he originally envisioned saving enough money to buy his own land, but quickly realized that the price of land in British Columbia would make such an approach prohibitively expensive. </p>

	<p>His solution: farming in people’s backyards, paying rent in fruits and vegetables. Every time Stone drops off produce at the restaurants he supplies, he collects buckets of vegetable trimmings to use as fertilizer. When he first started the business, he delivered the produce entirely by bike, sometimes towing as much as 180 kg of produce at once, thus reducing the carbon footprint of his farming.</p>

	<p>His proximity to the community is effective marketing when your clientele is looking to buy local. Selling produce is easier when people can see for themselves how the food is being grown, he added. <br />
“It doesn’t matter what political spectrum you’re on, everyone likes a garden,” said Stone. </p>

	<p>Stone told the 100 participants in attendance that he wants to diversify and decentralize the food system. Instead of 10 massive corporate farms feeding a city, he says he would prefer hundreds of smaller farms serving local communities. </p>

	<p>Ben Flanner, co-founder of Brooklyn Grange—a rooftop farm project in New York City—shared a similar approach in his own keynote speech. One of the project’s two farms is in a building with a café on the ground floor, from which the farm collects coffee grounds and vegetable trimmings to use as compost. </p>

	<p>Both organizations look at waste management as resource management, and say they avoid whenever possible using industrial fertilizer which may contain harmful chemicals. </p>

	<p>Concordia political sociology professor Satoshi Ikeda stressed the importance of eating organically during the CFC’s panel. He explained that as food is the primary determinant of a person’s health, bringing organic, non-<span class="caps">GMO</span> food to students should be a top priority.</p>

	<p>Although Ikeda admitted it wouldn’t be possible to create enough food to feed all Concordia students through initial urban agriculture initiatives by the university, he added they could nonetheless serve a greater purpose. </p>

	<p>“By creating many gardens, we would put pressure on the industry to change,” he said. </p>

	<p>Concordia economist Marguerite Mendell spoke about the larger implications of urban agriculture and alternative economics.</p>

	<p>“Rather than harvest food, I’d like to harvest some ideas,” she said.</p>

	<p>According to Mendell, on a larger scale, Western economies must do away with the neoliberal model of laissez-faire, free market economics and instead embrace a more social and cooperative economic model. She told attendees of her experience at a meeting held by the European Commission, where the host declared it in the best interest of Europe to seek a new economic paradigm. </p>

	<p>Espace/Vie/Emploi, an employment centre in Montreal, was praised by Mendell as the kind of inclusive institution that gets results. </p>

	<p>Other institutions taking action on the issue of food sovereignty—such as the vegan soup kitchen the People’s Potato and the anti-capitalist grocery store Le Frigo Vert—echoed the economic need to level the playing field by subsidizing or paying entirely for healthy and sustainable meals.</p>

	<p>After all of the speeches and panel discussions, conference attendees broke apart and participated in two-part discussion groups. During the first segment, they brainstormed broad responses to the question, “How do you go about developing a better food system at Concordia?” </p>

	<p>Participants came up with answers such as “collective value shift,” “productivity” and “thinking of waste management as resource management.”</p>

	<p>During the second part of the discussion period, attendees came up with more specific ideas on how to change the food system at Concordia. One group suggested a brewing and fermentation co-operative, where students would craft their own beer.</p>

	<p>Another group said the current for-profit Java U café on the mezzanine of the Hall Building must be replaced—as it is currently expected to be—with a student co-operative when the company’s lease runs out. They said the new co-op should be supplied with food grown in the Concordia Greenhouse and urban agriculture initiatives at the Loyola Campus.</p>

	<p>Before Java U took over the space in 1998, the second-floor housed the Mezz Café, a student-run endeavour that closed because it wasn’t profitable. </p>

					<p><br />

Boots, born Raymond Riley, is coming to Concordia Feb. 11 as the latest in the Concordia Student Union’s speaker series, this month presented in collaboration with the Concordia Caribbean Student Union and Students of History at Concordia.</p>

	<p>Riley’s music is best known from his Oakland-based hip-hop group The Coup, which has been active since the early ‘90s, and more recent work with Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello in the Street Sweeper Social Club.</p>

	<p>From the <span class="caps">MTV</span> crowd to the underground rap show, Boots does it all. After all, he got into music to reach out to as many people as possible.</p>

	<p>“Some of what’s informing the revolutionary aesthetic is a punk aesthetic. A punk aesthetic has to do with being rebellious against any number of people, but a punk aesthetic is not one with the aim of creating a revolution of touching the people that are not yet won over,” said Riley.</p>

	<p>“This is not about being underground, this is about being above ground. That’s what drives my whole artistic being; it’s what drives who I am.”</p>

	<p>Growing up with a father who belonged to the radical communist Union Labor Party, Riley had early insight into class struggles and a distaste for the current economic system. No matter the topic of his rhymes, he says that class dynamics are always present.</p>

	<p>“If you don’t have a class analysis [in protest music] that says this world is run by the exploitation of the working class’ labour by the ruling class, then you’re going to come up with all this other mystical shit of why things are fucked up,” said Riley.</p>

	<p>“And what you’re going to have is something angry and frustrating.”</p>

	<p>He criticizes protest art that only looks inward, saying that you can change inside all you want—but that you’ll only get angrier when the world doesn’t follow suit.</p>

	<p>This perspective, he says, comes more from his experience as an organizer than being a musician. What Riley preaches instead is optimism, and he says that his message is one that helps people realize their economic power.</p>

	<p>“The problems and possibilities are the same in almost every demographic of people in the world. One is they wish the world was different. Two is most of us think we have no power to affect change in the world. I don’t think that students are more optimistic than most people,” said Riley, who speaks at campuses multiple times a year. </p>

	<p>“I think sometimes they are in a material position where they have less to risk than someone who has to feed five kids. But I think they still suffer from the same pessimism.”</p>

	<p>He says people need to be reminded that they can change things, not just that things are bad—that people just need to see that there exists winnable battles over material change such as wages, housing and education.</p>

	<p>“Often we are told the system is evil, which it is, but in this conspiracy sort of way where there are five people in a room that control the world and there’s nothing you can do about it,” said Riley. “I think that optimism grows when there’s a movement, when people are fighting for material things together.”</p>

	<p>Riley was a prominent face of Occupy Oakland, where he’s lived most his life. It’s this lack of constructive mentality that led the movement to break down.</p>

	<p>“Nobody was meeting and saying, ‘How do we work with people and talk about these ideas?’” said Riley. “Some of that I can relate to an anarchist [perspective], trying to develop someone politically is tantamount to being an imperialist.”</p>

	<p>But that idea leaves groups only organizing with people who already agree with you, he says, creating “affinity groups” instead of community groups.</p>

	<p>“The unfortunate thing is that the new folks come in with the possibility of becoming more radicalized, but a lot of them were just shunned and went home,” said Riley.</p>

	<p>“I think organizers have a duty to know a lot of people. To be friendly, to make conversation wherever you are and to not have most of your friends be other organizers. If most of your friends are organizers, you’re not going to grow.”</p>

	<p>He argues that no successful social movement was made by creating a new group of people, that organizing has to be where you work, where you study—that it needs to be more than something extra-curricular.</p>

	<p>“If you consider yourself radical that means you want to build a revolutionary movement, and building a revolutionary movement can’t be made by forging an insular culture,” said Riley. </p>

	<p><strong>Boots Riley is speaking in the <span class="caps">CSU</span> lounge on the seventh floor of the Hall Building on Feb. 11, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Admission is free for students, and $5 for non-students.</strong></p>

			<p>Imagine you’re sitting in a room, minding your own beeswax and listening to some sweet Blink-182 tunes or whatever.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Halfway through Tom DeLonge’s skillful, three-note guitar solo, a phantom noise starts to infiltrate your ears, totally ruining the rockin’ vibe you had going on. </p>

	<p>That, my friends, is the sound of someone else playing another song while you’re playing one. It’s the sound of pure horror.</p>

	<p>The sheer terror I feel when two songs play at once is unparalleled. I imagine some sadistic, would-be DJ in another room, slowly turning the volume up on the song that is soon to become my living nightmare. I just don’t see how this situation is enjoyable for anyone involved—no party gets to actually enjoy the song they want to listen to, and I feel my blood pressure rising with every poorly matched beat. </p>

	<p>Sure, there’s the potential that some cool new song could come out of the combination of “Don’t Phunk With my Heart” and  “Livin’ on a Prayer,” but is it really worth the potential disaster that could ensue when those two songs come together in the catastrophic merging of Fergie’s grating voice and Jon Bon Jovi’s leather pants?</p>

	<p>I know mashups are what the kids are into these days, but this is just unnecessary. Quit your wannabe Skrillex-ing and wait until my damn song is finished.</p>

			<p>One certainty within the ever-changing landscape of our academic hub of a city is that there will always be students looking for places to live. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Whether from out of town or born and raised on the island, the “finding adequate housing” dance is a limbo many students know all too well.</p>

	<p>Recently, more and more companies have been seeking to take advantage of this fact: Private residences, with a bullseye on the backs and wallets of students, are popping up at an increasing rate en masse in Montreal. </p>

	<p>These dream buildings offer it all: they’re usually conveniently located downtown, they come fully-furnished and they include appliances, air, heat and the promise of safety. Despite the hefty pricetag, it sounds too good to be true—and often, it is.</p>

	<p>Recently, St. Cathy’s student residence, located right by Concordia’s Sir George Williams campus, was reported to have been in the midst of summer renovations that went on into the fall—well past their scheduled end date. </p>

	<p>The work went on, with tenants moving into rooms lacking the amenities advertising, come hell or high monthly rent rate.</p>

	<p>Since these kind of residences attract those who have travelled far to study in Montreal—they’re left with little knowledge of their rights, and how to make things better.</p>

	<p>In some cases with these residences, students can apply for and then pay for a room with a credit card over the Internet—almost no interaction with the landlord or owner required. </p>

	<p>It’s this sort of absenteeism that is the real issue. When things go wrong, there is no face to bring the problem to. Rushed construction jobs or poor living conditions are merely a symptom of a housing system with a serious disease.</p>

	<p>When tenants, be they students or not, find problems with their apartment, the legal avenue is to file paperwork with the Régie du logement, who will hear their case and consider it before providing a legal verdict.</p>

	<p>It’s a system that is supposed to protect the rights of the tenant, making landlords accountable for lease infractions or basic rights, such as an apartment actually being livable. </p>

	<p>But a complaint or report to the Régie can take up to 17 months to process, forcing many students to wait with their hands tied for legal action. Unless the situation is desperate, like a heater breakdown in the middle of the winter, or no running water at all, the everyday troubles of the student tenant are largely ignored, or at least legally delayed.</p>

	<p>By the time their day in court comes, there is a chance they have opted to move somewhere else, leaving the landlord to bring in the next tenants.</p>

	<p>This time constraint is especially troubling for exchange students, who are drawn to private residences and their furnished rooms and short-term leases. If anything is ill-suited to their needs, filing with the Régie is useless, as their time in the city will likely be long over before their grievances will be heard. They become victims of the flawed system.</p>

	<p>In this sense, students are vulnerable. Concordia’s Off-Campus Housing and Job Bank helps them navigate the complicated legal process that comes with filing a complaint with the Régie. </p>

	<p>But the fact is the mountain of confusing paperwork is only one step of many, another kink the backbone of the housing market’s crooked spine.</p>

	<p>This is not to say every landlord of every building is dishonest and irresponsible, but there are enough apartment horror stories circulating to validate these unfortunate instances as a sad reality.</p>

	<p>What we need now is real effort towards real change. We need a cure for the problem, not a band-aid. </p>

	<p>When we live in a place where it’s easier to move to another apartment than to get in touch with a landlord who won’t answer their phone or fulfill their responsibilities, we must greet it with actions greater than that of a shrug. </p>

	<p>“C’est la vie” simply can’t cut it for students finding themselves in precarious living conditions, or worse.</p>

	<p>There is already a push for this kind of change in the city, with organizations like Project Genesis focusing on improving housing conditions and actively lobbying for shorter complaint processing times with the Régie. </p>

	<p>But there needs to be a group effort. If there are to be any tangible changes, it’s up to each vertebrae of the system to straighten up and notice the wrongs.</p>

	<p>If what we need is stricter, more streamlined city-wide legislation over the places we call home, it’s as much our job to raise our voices and speak up about it as it is the government’s job to listen.</p>

			<p><i>Stinger Mukiya Post Brings Sports Gear to Caribbean Youth with Pass the Ball</i></p>

			<p>On the court, Concordia Stingers forward Mukiya Post has been counted on as a scorer, averaging a team-leading 14 points a game this season.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Off the court, however, Post has been delivering more assists in hopes of allowing others the chance to score.</p>

	<p>Mukiya is the co-founder of Pass the Ball, a non-profit organization that provides impoverished youth in the Caribbean with sports equipment.</p>

	<p>Post founded the organization with his brother, Keanau, who plays basketball at the University of Missouri, and also gets help from his mother and sister. </p>

	<p>Since last summer, Post has been collecting basketballs, soccer balls, rugby balls, and other sports gear from businesses, sports centres and schools, donating all of the equipment to Jamaica.</p>

	<p>“As long as [they’re] in usable condition, I take them,” said Post. </p>

	<p>Growing up in Jamaica after moving from British Columbia, Post had the idea to give back to his community during his high school days in B.C. </p>

	<p>However, Pass the Ball only went into motion last year, when Post took a year off from his studies at Bishop’s University. </p>

	<p>“It’s a process for sure,” he said. </p>

	<p>“Collecting the stuff, registering the charity, paperwork. I really dedicated myself to doing that and getting myself off the ground.</p>

	<p>“I always wanted to give back somehow.” </p>

	<p>Post had begun playing basketball at the age of seven, but was forced to stop playing when he moved to Jamaica, as his community didn’t have basketball rims to shoot at or basketballs to shoot with.  </p>

	<p>“Where I lived, we had a field and a soccer ball and that’s it,” he said. “We played barefoot.”</p>

	<p>Post remembers childhood friends who were unable to follow their athletic dreams because of lack of equipment, whether it was for soccer, volleyball or basketball. </p>

	<p>“They were very talented soccer players,” he said. </p>

	<p>“They couldn’t play on the soccer team because they didn’t have soccer cleats.”</p>

	<p>Post has already donated a batch of sports gear including balls, cleats, nets and jerseys to his primary school and a boy’s orphanage in Westmoreland, a province in Jamaica where Post was raised. He also plans on sending another shipment of equipment to Jamaica in March and one to Haiti later in the summer.</p>

	<p>“When I was younger, if somebody brought a soccer ball it was a huge difference in the community,” said Post. </p>

	<p>“It was a big deal.” </p>

	<p>Post aims to eventually deliver shipments of sporting goods to other countries in the Caribbean, every three months through his initiative. He would also like to organize an association that could fund sports teams to play against each other across countries in the Caribbean. </p>

	<p>Post is also interested in organizing free sports camps for kids, where he’d teach basketball and other sports skills. </p>

	<p>“I think sports are a great thing in children’s lives,” he said. </p>

	<p>“So I think it’s a great way to give back to them.” </p>

			<p><i>Stingers Captain George Lovatsis  Reflects on Career in Maroon and Gold</i></p>

			<p>When Concordia’s men’s hockey 2013-2014 season reaches its end, most players will be reflecting on a season filled with ups and downs, and looking forward to how they can improve for next year.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Months away from completing his final year of eligibility as a Stinger, team captain George Lovatsis will have things other than hockey on his mind.  </p>

	<p>“I’ll definitely miss being with my teammates every day, going downtown and to the Old Port,” said the Leisure Sciences major. </p>

	<p>“Montreal is such a unique city, I hope when I’m finished that I’ll be able to visit often.”</p>

	<p>A native of Markham, Ont., the 24-year-old centreman played three seasons in the Ontario Hockey League for the Kingston Frontenacs and Barrie Colts before joining the Stingers in the winter of 2009.  </p>

	<p>“I came to Concordia because I had some old teammates on the team,” said Lovatsis. </p>

	<p>“I also wanted to come to Montreal because it’s a great city,” added the Toronto Maple Leafs fan.</p>

	<p>Throughout his career, Lovatsis has collected some impressive statistics. </p>

	<p>He’s played a total of 121 games as a Stinger and has amassed 116 points, averaging nearly a point a game. He has also scored 51 goals, with his 50th goal coming in the Stingers’ 5-2 win over Nipissing University on Jan. 11.</p>

	<p>“It was a nice accomplishment to get [50] goals,” said Lovatsis. </p>

	<p>“I hope I can get [more] before the season ends.”</p>

	<p>Lovatsis, who spent previous years as an alternate captain, was elected team captain in a unanimous decision by coaches and teammates at the beginning of the season. </p>

	<p>“It was an honour to get the ‘C’ this year. It was a great learning experience and it truly allowed me to develop leadership skills,” said Lovatsis. </p>

	<p>“This is the youngest team I’ve had in my five-year career, so I did my best to guide and direct my teammates in the right direction for the future.”</p>

	<p>Under his leadership, the team has clinched a sixth-place finish in the Ontario University Athletics East Conference. It will mark the first time the Stingers make the playoffs since the 2010-2011 season.</p>

	<p>But that season isn’t the most memorable one for Lovatsis.</p>

	<p>Rather, his proudest moment came a season later, when he amassed 20 goals and 20 assists to finish the season with 40 points in just 28 games, fourth-most in the entire Canadian Interuniversity Sport that year. </p>

	<p>“That’s a difficult task to accomplish, and not many players can say they were at the top of the league in goals and points,” he said.</p>

	<p>The standings isn’t the only place Lovatsis has left his mark. </p>

	<p>“This is my third year playing alongside George, and every year he’s been taking on more and more of a leadership role,” said teammate and alternate captain Kyle Armstrong. </p>

	<p>“He’s a great guy to look [up to] and I hope to be as great a leader as him when I’m done.”</p>

	<p>Olivier Hinse, who also holds the title of alternate captain, had similar praise for his captain. </p>

	<p>“[George] is very mature, a real leader on and off the ice,” said the sophomore. </p>

	<p>“He may not always talk the most, but when he does, we listen. We have a very strong relationship and we work really well together.”</p>

	<p>When Lovatsis is the one in need of guidance on or off the ice, he usually turns to his girlfriend and former Stingers women’s hockey team captain Mallory Lawton.</p>

	<p>“I go to Mal for advice all the time,” said Lovatsis. </p>

	<p>“Whenever I need to, I’ll ask her for her advice. She does the same when the roles are reversed.”</p>

	<p>Lovatsis is especially grateful for the guidance of head coach Kevin Figsby. </p>

	<p>“It’s been great. He’s given me all the opportunities and chances in the world,” said Lovatsis. </p>

	<p>“I’m extremely thankful for that.”</p>

	<p>What’s next for Lovatsis is up in the air, but he’s mulling over some of his options.</p>

	<p>“I want to go to teachers college in Ontario and try to become a teacher,” he said.</p>

	<p>“If there is a hockey opportunity, either locally or abroad, I would like to pursue that as well.”</p>

	<p>Until then, Lovatsis has two regular season games and the playoffs left to play. </p>

	<p>“I’m anxious to get [the playoffs] started,” says Lovatsis. </p>

	<p>“I think if [goaltender Antonio Mastropietro] plays well, and all the other pieces fall into place for us, we have a real shot of going far.”</p>

			<p>North Carolina folk-pop group Lost In the Trees will be doling out baby trees during their Canadian tour. </p>
			
			
			<p>Ari Picker wanted to give his band “a dramatic feel to it” when he decided upon the moniker Lost in the Trees in 2007. Coincidentally, it’s the band’s music, not its name, that is helping keep Canada’s wilderness alive. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The five-piece orchestral folk-pop group from North Carolina is venturing through the forests of Canada this month and contributing to their growth, pairing with non-profit organization Tree Canada and handing out free tree saplings at their Canadian shows.</p>

	<p>“I worked in the music industry for almost two decades and met some amazing and inspiring people along the way,” said Richard Walker, head of communications at Tree Canada. “One of them works for [Lost in the Trees]’ Canadian label and posted a song of theirs on Facebook.</p>

	<p>“After listening to it, I instantly loved the band,” he continued. “I contacted my friend and asked [if they could do] something with Tree Canada during their Canadian leg of the tour.”</p>

	<p>A trip to Canada was the last thing on Picker’s mind when he first started the band seven years ago.</p>

	<p>After graduating from Berklee College of Music in Boston with a formal training in classical music, Picker wanted to burst out of his academic bubble with the creation of Lost In the Trees.</p>

	<p>“After college I was listening to a lot more contemporary music and seeing a lot of bands at festivals, so I was less isolated musically speaking,” said Picker, the band’s writer and lead vocalist.</p>

	<p>Picker started by writing songs in his bedroom and sending out demo CDs to record companies. He eventually formed the band with friends he had met in the orchestral music program and they were signed to Trekky Records.</p>

	<p>Over the years, Picker says the band has changed in significant ways, with the size fluctuating and plenty of experimentation done within different musical genres.</p>

	<p>“Our past records were influenced by classical music, because that’s what I was studying and I was in my classical bubble,” he said.</p>

	<p>Their newest album, <em>Past Life</em>, set to be released on Feb. 18, has minimalist modern sounds and puts an emphasis on rhythm and groove.</p>

	<p>“This album is more abstract and open. We tried to be more hands-on and develop an emotional reaction from listeners, versus having a particular theme like the past album,” Picker said. “The purpose was having fun making this record during the process.”</p>

	<p>The band’s intention was to move away from themes of loss—their previous record, <em>A Church That Fits Our Needs</em>, released in 2012, was largely fuelled by Picker’s mother’s suicide in 2008.</p>

	<p>“I think each album is its own musical experiment. I wanted the process to be more external whereas the others were a lot more personal and intentional. The goal was to make this album more spontaneous, fun and free,” he said.</p>

	<p>“So it turned out a lot more pop. The song structures are based on loops and beats. So, it’s definitely more groovy, and a little fancy and certainly a lot more powerful to play live.”</p>

	<p>Picker explained that many of his inspirations came from paintings he had seen in museums, poems he had written and books he had read.</p>

	<p>“It was assembled like a collage—copy-paste kind of lyrical experiment versus every line having a ton of weight,” he said.</p>

	<p><strong>A Bag of Trees</strong></p>

	<p>Aware of the large carbon footprint a touring band leaves behind, Lost in the Trees decided to collaborate with non-profit green organization Tree Canada for their Canadian tour this month.</p>

	<p>“Music has many purposes, and one of them is a responsibility not only for the creation of art but to leave a positive impact in other ways,” said Picker.</p>

	<p>Tree Canada’s mission is to maintain a healthy environment in the true North by sustaining urban and rural forests. Thus far, the group has planted over 80 million trees across Canada through different and diverse programs. Their goal is to raise awareness of the importance of trees to all age groups.</p>

	<p>At the end of every concert during their Canadian tour, tree saplings will be distributed to fans. They are then encouraged to nurture the saplings into thriving trees, in order to replenish the Earth with life.</p>

	<p>Walker said that Tree Canada collaborating with Lost In the Trees was “the perfect vehicle to engage a demographic through something they love.”</p>

	<p>“We even have a contest set up for people who pick up saplings to post how they will care for the tree and where they will plant it. Prize packs will be given to the best plants in each city,” Walker said.</p>

	<p>“The best thing to do is to plant it in a pot with some soil, water it every other day until the ground thaws and plant in your backyard or neighbourhood park. The best times to plant are late April to mid June and late August to late October,” he added.</p>

			<p><i>New Montreal Play Takes On Gender  and Class Issues in the Fashion Industry</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/Fringe/21fr.Unseamly.Graeme_690_987_90.jpg" alt="" />
			<p>Infinitheatre&#8217;s new production gives insight into the struggles of a woman battling sexism and harassment in the fashion industry. Graphic Graeme Shorten Adams</p>
			
			
			<p>Anyone familiar with American Apparel’s sexual harassment scandals in the past few years will likely find a parallel with Infinitheatre’s latest production about the perils of being a woman in the fashion world’s highly sexualized workplace.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><em>Unseamly</em>, co-directed by Concordia alumnus Sarah Carlsen, aims to unzip this hidden world and bring it into the harsh light of accountability.</p>

	<p>“I have friends who were on the pre-jury who didn’t even know if they wanted to come see it,” said Carlsen. “But the reason they don’t want to see it is the reason I want to put it on.”</p>

	<p>The play tells the story of a young woman, Malina, who consults legal advice over whether to accuse her former boss, international clothing company <span class="caps">CEO</span> Ira Slatsky, of sexual harassment—not unlike the numerous lawsuits former Amerian Apparel employees have filed against the company’s <span class="caps">CEO</span>, Dov Charney, over the past few years. The majority of them have been settled out of court or dismissed.</p>

	<p>Slatsky appears to be a charming man and even a “revolutionary machine of human justice” at first, according to Carlsen, who uses ethical labour practices and lets workers at all levels of his company contact him directly.</p>

	<p>But when it comes to women, especially Latina ones, Slatsky has no scruples about exploiting and abusing their sexuality to sell his products and more.</p>

	<p>Carlsen says Slatsky is “a man who makes you laugh in one second, and scares the shit out of you in another”—not to mention a “man-child archetype” given huge authority by wealth and entrenched privilege—who could likely remind those in the audience of leering bosses they’ve had in the past.</p>

	<p>“Why couldn’t you have picked that script about the girl with the dead father?” Carlsen recalls being asked. While bleak itself, the alternative script at least carries the possibility of a simple, universally satisfying resolution that raises no unsettling questions about the society we live in.</p>

	<p>That, however, is not the kind of play Carlsen wants to put on.</p>

	<p>“Good art actually does separate people, it doesn’t just bring them together,” Carlsen mused. She says some people will walk out of <em>Unseamly</em> thinking they’ve just seen “smut,” while others, she hopes, will recognize in its themes things they’ve thought but never said, most notably in the female audience members, where it might hit closest to home.</p>

	<p>“You couldn’t produce this without a woman director or co-director, it’s just not possible,” she said.</p>

	<p><em>Unseamly</em> tells a story that is around us every day. It asks, as Carlsen puts it, what if the girl on one of those billboards you see on every block—the girl with the perfectly toned body, wind-blown hair and vaguely orgasmic expression—stepped out of that picture and told you what she had to do to get there?</p>

	<p>Lead actress Arlen Aguayo Stewart says she has worked in the fashion industry and found it every bit as exploitative and discriminatory as it is portrayed in the play. She auditioned on a recommendation from a friend, recognizing its relevance to her own experience.</p>

	<p>Stewart is also interested in bringing her perspective as a Latina woman to the foreground. The play’s protagonist is Latina like her.</p>

	<p>“What I really want to bring to it is a more realistic depiction of a woman from a Latino background. She’s the only woman onstage for a lot of the time so I just want to give her as much strength as possible,” Stewart said.</p>

	<p>Carlsen hopes the new production will ignite a dialogue on the issue.</p>

	<p>“Almost every rehearsal, tears come to my eyes,” she said. “This play is waking me up again.”</p>

			<p><i>Skysmith Cinedrones Bring  Cinematography to New Heights</i></p>

			<p>No one can deny that modern technology is reaching unimaginable new heights—but when it comes to film, this statement can be taken literally. Drones have now been introduced to the cinematography scene, and Skysmith Cinedrones is flying them down an artistic path. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Tim Zafir, a Concordia graduate who majored in Communication Studies with a focus in film, has been at the forefront of this new cinematic technology, growing out of his love for flexible camera movement.</p>

	<p>“Me and some of my mates were always interested in camera movement particularly, so we were building cable cameras and cranes and dollies and little robotic heads and whatnot for filming and getting cooler and cooler shots every time,” he said.</p>

	<p>Although it began as just an interest, Zafir’s experimenting, and the ideas that went along with it, brought his work to the forefront of contemporary mobile-operated camera technology.</p>

	<p>“In the last two years, the multi-rotor popular name drones have come into the [amateur] filming world and even more recently into the professional filming world,” he said.</p>

	<p>“In the past [professionals] have had the budget to shoot with helicopters and whatnot so there hasn’t really been too big a need, but now we’re able to get really close with the shots and get really intimate scenes then pull out really far to show breathtaking landscapes.</p>

	<p>“That’s a new technique that never really existed before in cinema.”</p>

	<p>With such an exciting new tool, it wasn&#8217;t hard to get a team on board. Benjamin Granet—who was working as a stone carver before meeting Zafir—was quickly drawn into the art form.</p>

	<p>“Tim was always talking about the drones, the drones, the drones, and I was curious to see what he was talking about,” said Granet.</p>

	<p>“One weekend Tim asked if I wanted to go filming and I said yeah, of course. So we went for a small filming and I really enjoyed it, […] I was really interested.”</p>

	<p><strong>Cameras Roaming the Skies</strong></p>

	<p>Skysmith’s filming drones are remote-controlled flying machines with a mounted camera and a small <span class="caps">CPU</span> inside, attached to various types of sensors. A gyroscope keeps the drone balanced and stabilizes the camera, the barometer stabilizes the altitude and a <span class="caps">GPS</span> keeps it on course.</p>

	<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/71032158" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

	<p>Zafir was able to coordinate with Canada’s first drone manufacturer, DronExperts, to solicit the resources to get Skysmith off the ground, so to speak.</p>

	<p>“I met a commercial pilot and he was building multi-rotor helicopters more for the purpose of industrial uses and lower-end filming of weddings and things like that,” Zafir said. “I came to him with the need of building bigger, badder machines so we can put bigger, badder cameras on there and get shots that have never been seen before in cinema.”</p>

	<p>With DronExperts as a resource, Zafir and Granet have been able to concentrate more on the artistic side of production.</p>

	<p>“I like the idea that DroneExperts and Skysmith are brothers in the same family,” Zafir said. “They’re helping us with the technologies and the resources we need to grow as an artistic company.</p>

	<p>“But at the end of the day, technology is technology and it’s nothing without the humans behind it,” he continued. “I’m more concerned with creating the teams and pushing the artful uses of this technology instead of focusing on the dollar.”</p>

	<p><strong>All New Possibilities</strong></p>

	<p>Skysmith sees more potential for drones than just capturing breathtaking cinematography.</p>

	<p>Because much of the footage captured by their machines is so rare to attain, it has a lot of power, and to Zafir it offers the opportunity to do a lot of good.</p>

	<p>“What really attracts me is any opportunity for us to get into the frontier locations,” said Zafir. “For instance, Ben and I are planning on going down to Patagonia to film a bunch of aerials for the conservation projects fighting the foreign hydroelectric dams that are coming in there and wanting to dam up the Patagonian mountain region between Chile and Argentina.</p>

	<p>“It’s one of these last wilderness frontiers that is somewhat untouched by man and there are people down there wanting to protect it,” he explained. “The problem is they don’t have a massive voice because there are so few of them and it’s far away from the rest of the world, so we want to go down there and give them images that will really speak to the hearts of the public.”</p>

	<p>But beyond their power for change, drones also aid cinematographers in their own exploration.</p>

	<p>“It’s exciting—when I was standing there on this glacier in Iceland last year with a bunch of ice climbers and mountain guides and we were flying across this glacial tongue,” Zafir said.</p>

	<p>“For the first time they were seeing images and new routes through this glacier which they could now go through. So we were pioneering, we were basically seeing images and opportunities in these incredibly rugged landscapes that have never been seen before.”</p>

	<p>But the company knows full well that untrodden trails will make for hard hiking, both physically and financially.</p>

	<p>“It’s new. As far as the industry goes, we’re not just trying to work; we’re also trying to create our job at the same time,” said Zafir. “We’re paving the path while we’re walking on it.”</p>

			<p>After reviving their season with a six-game winning streak, the Concordia Stingers men’s basketball team has lost three straight games, including back-to-back losses to the Bishop’s Gaiters this past weekend.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The Stingers dropped Friday’s game by a score of 73-64, and despite their valiant comeback effort Saturday, they lost again 64-61. </p>

	<p>After being unbeaten in 2014 up until now, the Stingers now have a .500 record at 6-6.</p>

	<p>“We didn’t do the things that we needed to do these last two games,” said Mukiya Post, who scored 20 points off the bench Saturday afternoon.</p>

	<p>Both teams kept it close on Friday, but the Gaiters almost ran away with the game on Saturday, ending the first quarter up 20-8. </p>

	<p>The Stingers made a game of it off the strength of Post’s 20 points and Jean-André Moussignac’s 15, including four three-pointers. In the end though, the Stingers couldn’t get the win.</p>

	<p>The Stingers will play host to the <span class="caps">UQAM</span> Citadins on Thursday, Feb. 13th at 8 p.m., before playing at Laval Saturday evening.</p>

			<p>The Stingers women’s basketball team have now won six straight games after sweeping a home and home series versus the Bishop’s Gaiters.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>After winning Friday by a score of 55-49 on the road, the Stingers beat the Gaiters at home Saturday by a score of 68-41.</p>

	<p>Despite trailing for most of their game on Friday, and shooting almost 31% from the field on Saturday, the Stingers did enough to secure victories this past weekend. The Bishop’s Gaiters remain winless so far this season, sitting last in the Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec Conference at 0-12.</p>

	<p>“It doesn’t matter whether you’re playing the top of the league or the bottom of the league,” said Stingers head coach Keith Pruden after Saturday’s game. </p>

	<p>“You’ve got to treat every opponent the same way.”</p>

	<p>Alex Boudreau had a great weekend for the Stingers, scoring 18 points on Friday night, followed by 14 on Saturday. Marilyse Roy-Viau was also dominant, with 11 points and five rebounds Friday evening, and a double-double on Saturday with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p>

	<p>Reigning <span class="caps">MVP</span> and All-Canadian Kaylah Barrett sat out Friday night’s game against Bishops, and only played a total of 10 minutes on Saturday afternoon before leaving the game due to discomfort in her back. </p>

	<p>Barrett is expected to be healthy in time for the Stingers’ next game against <span class="caps">UQAM</span> on Thursday, Feb.13th at 6 p.m. They also round out the weekend against the Laval Rouge et Or Saturday evening at 5 p.m.</p>

			<p>Less than 24 hours after a trip to the nation’s capital left the Stingers men’s hockey team stunned and shaking their heads due to a 4-3 shootout loss, Concordia’s squad regrouped and displayed a great 60-minute effort, winning 4-2 against the University of Ontario Institute of Technology Ridgebacks.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>“We played really well this weekend, good enough for all four points,” said Stingers head coach Kevin Figsby.</p>

	<p>“I thought our guys played really well [Friday] and I thought we played really well today.”</p>

	<p>Friday night’s game against the Ottawa Gee-Gees saw the Stingers unable to hold a lead—three separate times they went ahead, and each time the Gee-Gees’ offence came back and tied the game up. </p>

	<p>That included tying the game up in the last minute on a powerplay goal by sophomore forward Andrew Creppin, sending the game to extra time. </p>

	<p>The Stingers eventually went to a shootout where the Gee-Gees scored two of three on goaltender Antonio Mastropietro.</p>

	<p>“Our team as a whole played a great weekend,” said alternate captain Olivier Hinse. </p>

	<p>“We just caught a bad break at the end of [Friday’s] game. Today, we were all on the same page, and all worked together, and it was really nice to see.”</p>

	<p>The loss Friday overshadowed the performance of rookie forward Hugo Vincent’s two-goal game, his sixth in 15 games after sitting out his team’s first 11 games.</p>

	<p>Just three minutes into the game, another loss was felt in the room, when rookie defender Jeremy Barriault took a cross check against the boards, and couldn’t finish the game in what was later determined to be a hip pointer injury. He didn’t dress for Saturday’s game.</p>

	<p>Saturday afternoon the Stingers seemed well rested and ready to take on the Ridgebacks, a team who had lost the night before 9-2 at the hands of Canadian Interuniversity Sport’s no. 6 ranked McGill Redmen.</p>

	<p>It didn’t take long for Concordia to get onto the board as just under four minutes into the game, alternate captain Kyle Armstrong, playing on the wing for the first time since midget, took a feed from fellow alternate captain Olivier Hinse and made no mistake wristing a shot from the slot to make it 1-0. </p>

	<p>For Armstrong, it was his second goal in two games.</p>

	<p>“[It’s the] first time all year I’ve been placed on the first line, and it felt good,” said Armstrong. </p>

	<p>“I tried to contribute as much as I could, and it worked.”</p>

	<p>The Ridgebacks were quick to respond however when 77 seconds later they equalized when defender Ryan Zupancic tied the game at one-apiece.</p>

	<p>One Stinger who was definitely playing some good hockey all weekend was goaltender Mastropietro, who made some key saves in both games, keeping them close.</p>

	<p>Late in the first the Stingers went ahead when Dany Potvin got a perfect feed from Hinse, who then put the team up 2-1. </p>

	<p>The Ridgebacks tied it at two on the powerplay, jumping on a rebound that Mastropietro couldn’t handle.</p>

	<p>Late in the period, a great hustle by fourth-year forward Robert Mormina found an open Francis Beauregard who beat Ridgeback goaltender Colin Dzijacky upstairs.  </p>

	<p>During the last frame, Stingers captain George Lovatsis gave Concordia a 4-2 lead with his ninth of the season, and 51st of his <span class="caps">CIS</span> career.</p>

	<p>Figsby was pleased with his boys’ overall effort on the weekend, knowing that two wins weren’t far out of reach, but three out of four points made a solid weekend.</p>

	<p>“I’m extremely proud of the way our guys played and handled themselves this weekend,” said Figsby. </p>

	<p>“Especially with a little bit of adversity, we fought hard.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers close out their season next weekend travelling to face the Royal Military College Paladins Friday evening in Kingston, and then finish off the regular season Saturday afternoon against the Gee-Gees at Ed Meagher Arena. Puck drop is 2 p.m.</p>

			<p><i>Second-Period Slump Costs Stingers in 6-2 Loss to Martlets</i></p>

			<p>If Sunday’s game against the McGill Martlets was a preview of what’s to come, the Stingers women’s hockey team’s first postseason appearance since the 2010-2011 season might be a brief one.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>After securing the fourth spot in the Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec conference last week, the Stingers took on the first-place Martlets over the weekend in their penultimate regular season game. What started out as a close contest ended up being a blowout, as the Stingers lost 6-2. </p>

	<p>“When we play [McGill] they&#8217;re always really good intense games, everyone gets really involved,” said Stingers team captain Erin Lally who, despite Sunday&#8217;s loss, is already excited for a rematch.</p>

	<p>“I know we&#8217;re really looking forward to the playoffs; we&#8217;re right where we wanted to be.”</p>

	<p>In their five games against McGill this season—all losses—Concordia was outscored a combined 23-7. </p>

	<p>Though the statistics show they lost by four goals over the weekend, the Stingers nonetheless showed they can hold their own against the no. 1 team in the entire Canadian Interuniversity Sport. </p>

	<p>Not even five minutes into the game, Stingers centre Alyssa Sherrard was penalized for bodychecking, giving McGill an early power play. </p>

	<p>But the Martlets weren&#8217;t able to get a clear shot on goal for the entire two minutes, and by the end of their power play had accrued a penalty of their own by forward Chelsey Saunders.</p>

	<p>Both penalized players came back later in the period to score goals; Saunders scored first, but the goal was swiftly followed by one from Sherrard, tying up the game at 1-1. </p>

	<p>The tie didn&#8217;t last long, however. </p>

	<p>Early in the second period, Martlets senior forward Logan Murray scored in the final seconds of a power play. After a string of incredible saves by Stingers rookie goalie Briar Bache, McGill found the back of the net three more times in the period to take a 5-1 lead into the final frame. </p>

	<p>“We had about 10 minutes in the second period where it just cost us a lot of goals,” said Concordia head coach Les Lawton. </p>

	<p>“With a team like that you gotta play 60 minutes and we just got maybe 50 or 52 minutes out of our team today. [&#8230;] After they scored it just took [our] momentum away.”</p>

	<p>The game wrapped up with one more goal for McGill and Concordia each in the third period, finishing 6-2. Both Stinger goals were scored by fourth-year centre Alyssa Sherrard, who leads the team with 14 points.</p>

	<p>Despite the loss, Lawton has high hopes for the postseason. </p>

	<p>“[The Martlets are] one of the top teams in the country and hopefully we can put ourselves in a position where we can steal a game or two and win,” he said. </p>

	<p>The Stingers conclude their regular season on Friday, Feb. 14 at 7:30 p.m. against the Ottawa Gee-Gees at the Ed Meagher Arena.</p>

			<p>During the Super Bowl on Feb. 2, one Twitter trend stood out from the rest. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The #NotYourMascot campaign aimed to get the word out about &#8220;racist&#8221; team names and Native cultural appropriations.</p>

	<p>The campaign was part of an effort to get the <span class="caps">NFL</span> team Washington Redskins to change their name, which many Native peoples find offensive. Days before the Super Bowl, the National Congress of American Indians released a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR-tbOxlhvE">video</a> in support of the #ChangeTheName drive. </p>

	<p>Closer to home, Quebec chips manufacturer Yum Yums caused a similar controversy in November when it decided to bring back its retro “little Indian logo.” </p>

	<p>Tiffany Harrington is a McGill student and a member of the school’s Indigenous Student Alliance. She composed this spoken word poem about Native cultural appropriation last year. </p>

			<p><i>Ongoing Custody Battle Halts Forced Return to Mexico</i></p>

					<p>The deportation date for Ivonne Hernandez, a Mexican refugee claimant who was to be deported without her Canadian-born infant on Friday, has been pushed back so she can make arrangements for her ongoing custody battle for her son.</p>

	<p>“She just collapsed when she heard the good news,” said Annie Lapalme of Solidarity Across Borders’ Montreal division, one of the groups supporting her cause. “There’s definitely hope for [her custody case hearing].”</p>

	<p>Following the Jan. 10 ruling of a Superior Court judge in St-Jérôme, Hernandez lost custody of her 13-month-old son due to her lack of refugee status, despite her claims that the father had abused her psychologically and physically. </p>

	<p>Her deportation date was then set a month before a hearing granting her a last chance at regaining custody of her son on March 6.</p>

	<p>“She had been misrepresented—it was a very last-minute thing. This time around, she’ll be properly prepared as she’ll have the time to devise a strategy with her new lawyer,” said Lapalme.</p>

	<p>She added that they did not yet know how long the removal date had been pushed back, but that it would grant her enough time to try and regain custody of her infant son, which her immigration lawyer Stewart Istvanffy deemed the first priority <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/5417">at a press conference Monday morning</a>. </p>

			<p><i>Protesters Demand More Social Housing in the Sud-Ouest</i></p>

			<h3>So many condos and trendy shops have sprung up in St-Henri that even Patricia Viannay’s nine-year-old daughter can spot the differences.</h3>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p><br />

A member of local tenants’ rights organization P.O.P.I.R. – Comité Logement and a resident of the neighbourhood since 2009, Viannay was among more than 100 protesters who marched through Montreal’s Sud-Ouest borough on Saturday demanding the construction of social housing. </p>

	<p>“Tenants are being driven out of the neighbourhood,” she said. “We have many elderly residents who have been living here for 20 or 30 years and they’re being forced out by property owners who want to convert their building into condos.</p>

	<p>“They have nowhere to go because all these condos and real estate speculation has raised rents and property taxes.” </p>

	<p>The marchers were calling for 2,800 social housing units to be built in the Sud-Ouest, which they say would account for the families who spend half their income or more on rent. The protest was part of the Front d’action populaire en réaménagement urbaine’s campaign calling for 50,000 new subsidized housing units province-wide within the next five years.</p>

	<p>“There are many single people and families around here that need social housing,” said Alfred Thorne, who has lived on the other side of the Lachine Canal in Verdun for 25 years. Since he moved in, he says condos have changed the face of his neighbourhood as well.</p>

	<p><strong>A Luxurious Shave</strong></p>

	<p>As the crowd cut across the neighbourhood walking along Notre-Dame St., event organizers pointed out new restaurants and shops that they described as symptoms of gentrification, including the luxury men’s barbershop Notorious. </p>

	<p>Open since September, the Versace-furnished salon is known for offering a $1,000 shave. Customers who pay top dollar can expect to be shaved with a gold razor, which is later dulled so that they can take it home. </p>

				</blockquote>
								
				
					<p>In an interview with <em>The Link</em>, Corey Shapiro, who co-owns Notorious with Patrick Gemayel, also known as P-Thugg from electro-pop group Chromeo, said shops like theirs benefit the neighbourhood.</p>

	<p>“What an ignorant thing to say that it’s bad to gentrify a ’hood that’s run-down,” said Shapiro. “We’re not a large corporation; we’re a hardworking artist and businessman, self-made from Montreal who have decided to inject money in an area. </p>

	<p>“People should want to better themselves. No one wants to stay in a run-down apartment with cockroaches and rats—no one,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“This is a neighbourhood shop that respects others. There’s something here for everyone,” he added, pointing out that the barbershop’s prices start at $15.</p>

	<p><strong>Condos and Rising Prices</strong></p>

	<p>At the corner of St. Ambroise St. and St. Rémi St., the protesters stopped to drape a banner calling for social housing over a billboard advertising the L’Alcôve sur le Woonerf condo development. The price for a one-bedroom unit in the building starts at around $160,000.</p>

	<p>Pointing to the McGill University Health Centre superhospital construction site in the distance, Valérie Simard, a community organizer at P.O.P.I.R., said the condominiums are being built specifically for the doctors and nurses who’ll soon be working on the hill.</p>

	<p>“This is one of the most disadvantaged parts of St-Henri,” Simard said, walking along St. Ambroise St. near the old Canada Malt Factory. “Gentrification always starts from the centre and moves outward. We know this area is the next step.”</p>

	<p>Local residents and members of P.O.P.I.R. <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4623">have long been rallying in opposition to the conversion</a> of the defunct malt factory into a 600-unit condo complex. In December, protesters carrying homemade lanterns marched to the Sud-Ouest borough hall to deliver a petition with over 1,500 signatures asking that the factory be saved. </p>

	<p>Simard added that public investments in that part of St-Henri are being made to pave the way for more condos. After years of planning, the borough finally unveiled the Woonerf Saint-Pierre, a pedestrian-only “green” alleyway, in the fall.</p>

	<p>“The Woonerf is one of the prides of the Sud-Ouest [borough] administration,” Simard said. “But we know it’s just the first step in the so-called revitalization of the area to bring in developers and to encourage people to move into the neighbourhood.”</p>

	<p>A protest against federal cuts to subsidized housing is planned for Feb. 9, two days before Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty will deliver the 2014 budget. The federal government devotes $2 billion to social housing, down from $3.2 billion four years ago, according to <em>The Montreal Gazette</em>.</p>

			<p><i>Social Justice Activist Leila Bdeir Speaks at Concordia about the Muslim Feminist Movement’s Response to Bill 60</i></p>

			<h3>Quebec feminists and other progressive forces are currently confronted with an “important philosophical dilemma” in the debate surrounding the wearing of religious symbols, says self-described Muslim feminist and social justice activist Leila Bdeir.</h3>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

A founding member of the Collective des féministes musulmanes du Québec, blogger and professor of humanities and women’s studies at Vanier College, Bdeir kicked off the Concordia-based Centre for Gender Advocacy’s lecture series on race, gender and political resistance last Thursday by speaking about Islamophobia, media representations of Muslim women and the Parti Québécois government’s proposed Charter of Quebec Values.</p>

	<p>The charter—which has not yet been passed in Quebec’s National Assembly—seeks to ban public sector employees from <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4546">wearing “ostentatious” religious symbols</a> such as turbans, hijabs, niqabs, kippas and large crosses. Some feminists have declared their support for the charter, also known as Bill 60.</p>

	<p>“If [Quebec feminists] believe that the right to self-determination constitutes an essential principle for women’s equality, does this right also apply to women whose active self-definition leads to choices outside the Western secular norm?” said Bdeir, explaining the dilemma facing the province’s feminists.</p>

	<p>“In other words, are Quebec feminists willing to live with a certain number of realities with which they are uncomfortable in order to respect the right to self-definition of all women?”</p>

	<p>Bdeir offered an open letter written by 88-year-old former Quebec television personality Janette Bertrand as an example of how some feminists see Muslim women who wear a religious headscarf.</p>

	<p>“At this moment, the principle of equality between the sexes seems to be compromised for the sake of freedom of religion,” reads the <a href="http://www.lapresse.ca/debats/votre-opinion/201310/11/01-4699030-une-charte-pour-les-femmes.php">French-language letter published by <em>La Presse</em></a> on Oct. 15. The letter states that men used to, and continue to, use religion in order to “dominate women, put them in their place, meaning beneath them.”</p>

	<p>Bertrand’s letter was co-signed by 20 other feminists, many of them well-known personalities in Quebec, such as Djemila Benhabib, an opponent of political Islam and candidate for the PQ in the 2012 provincial election, and TV host Julie Snyder.</p>

	<p>According to Bdeir, the letter is just one example of “how a significant number of feminists aspiring to what they describe as ‘universal women’s rights’ actively reproduce paternalistic and oppressive practices.”</p>

	<p>In wider society, Muslim women are often seen as both victims of oppressive religious practices—despite the protestations of Muslim women who say they freely choose to wear the hijab—and threats to state secularism, as in the case in the debate on the charter, Bdeir continued. </p>

	<p>“Muslim women and their religiously motivated attire are now seen as the principle threat to <em>laïcité</em> and Quebec identity,” she said. “No longer are Muslim women only perceived as dangers to themselves, but they are now perceived to pose a threat to the nation as well.”</p>

	<p>Bdeir told the audience that Muslim women are speaking up both in favour of and against the charter, but that a “double standard” exists that favours those on the pro-charter side.</p>

	<p>“Rarely are Arab and Muslim women who come out in favour of the charter accused of not thinking for themselves by the majority group,” Bdeir said. “Theirs are taken to be the legitimate voices of reason in support of the project.”</p>

	<p><em><span class="caps">CORRECTION</span>: The original version of this article stated that Leila Bdeir is “a spokesperson of activist group Présence musulmane.” In fact, Bdeir is no longer a spokesperson for the group, as Présence musulmane no longer exists. Bdeir is, however, a founding member of the Collective des féministes musulmanes du Québec. The article has been updated accordingly.</em> The Link <em>regrets the error.</em></p>

			<p><i>Alleges Abuse at the Hands of Husband</i></p>

					<p><em><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/5420">Ivonne Hernandez&#8217;s deportation date has been pushed back</a></em></p>

	<h3>Ivonne Hernandez fled four different states in Mexico, but she says her alleged abuser always caught up with her. </h3>

	<p><br />

Seeking asylum from domestic violence, her escape led her to Montreal in 2009, where she eventually got married and had a child, but again ended up facing abuse. </p>

	<p>Now after having lived in Canada without status for about a year-and-a-half, Hernandez, 41, is facing deportation on Feb. 7 without her 13-month-old son. </p>

	<p>Her situation is not uncommon among many Mexican women now seeking asylum in Canada, and is raising questions about the country’s treatment of refugee claimants, according to organizations speaking out on her case and fighting for her to stay in Canada. </p>

	<p>“We’ve seen a few cases of women asking for refugee status in Canada, and who have been victims of violence [while] in the country,” president of the Fédération des femmes du Québec, Alexa Conradi, told <em>The Link</em> after a press conference held by the <span class="caps">FFQ</span> on Monday. </p>

	<p>“The Canadian response has been, ‘If you just [leave the country] you’ll be fine, we recognize that you are a victim, but you need to go back and just move somewhere else.’” </p>

	<p>Those organizations—Doctors Without Borders, the <span class="caps">FFQ</span>, Québec solidaire and Solidarity Across Borders—are advocating for Hernandez to “at least gain custody of her child, whether that be in Mexico or in Canada, that’s priority number one,” said her lawyer, Stewart Istvanffy. </p>

	<p>But the March 6 hearing date to regain care of her child, who she only gets to see eight hours a week, is set a month after she has to leave the country. </p>

	<p>Hernandez was denied custody due to her lack of status in a rushed hearing at the Superior Court in St-Jérôme on Jan. 10, initiated by the father after she left him with her son for a women’s shelter. Hernandez says the judge ignored her domestic violence claims. </p>

	<p>“Without considering her parental capacity and without investigating the parental capacity of the father either,” said Sonia Dionne, director of the Maison d’hébergement Le Parados where Hernandez is living, at the press conference.  </p>

	<p>“The child is well developed. She took care of him alone and he is safe with her—we saw that, but who asked us this before taking her child away? No one,” she added.  </p>

	<p>On Jan. 22, Hernandez was arrested by border police at Berri-<span class="caps">UQAM</span> metro station, where she was to pick up her child from his father. </p>

	<p>She had been living at the women’s shelter with her son since December, after leaving her husband, who she alleges has abused her physically and psychologically. </p>

	<p>Hernandez was released on Jan. 24 on a $4,000 cash bond and is required to report to immigration authorities regularly. </p>

	<p>“I am guilty because I want to be free of that situation? I don’t think so because all women, we need to be protected, we need to live in an environment clean from violence,” said Hernandez at the press conference, tears welling up in her eyes.</p>

	<p>In October 2011, she was denied refugee status on the basis that Mexico is considered to be a “safe country.” Last February, then-Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney added Mexico to a list of countries considered “safe,” making it harder for refugee claimants like Hernandez to get asylum in Canada. </p>

	<p>“This is an extremely hypocritical way of refusing people who really are in danger. There’s really no protection in Mexico,” said Istvanffy, citing a judgment made by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that claimed there was next to no protection for Mexican women facing gender-based violence.  	</p>

	<p>Four months pregnant and despite facing the risk of being deported at any moment, she decided to stay because “she was happy, she was married,” said Istvanffy. </p>

	<p>Things went downhill from there. Her husband regularly threatened to denounce her to authorities, Hernandez said. Her decision to leave him was not easy though. </p>

	<p>“I investigated months before because I knew it was dangerous for my baby, I tried to get the best advice that I could before I left,” said Hernandez. </p>

	<p>“In these types of situations, often there’s abuse in the relationship between the person who is sponsoring and the person who is being sponsored. And often, they play around with this question of the papers,” said Istvanffy.</p>

	<p>All speakers present at the press conference stressed the need for better protection for people in “these types of relationships.” </p>

	<p>“The message being given, today, is if you leave the guy, you can lose everything,” added Istvanffy. </p>

	<p>Due to privacy laws and because “removals are a [Canadian Border Services Agency] matter,” Citizenship and Immigration Canada were unable to give comment on the case.</p>

	<p>In an email statement to <em>The Link</em>, <span class="caps">CBSA</span> communications advisor Jacqueline Roby said, “It is necessary to proceed with the removal of failed asylum seekers and people who do not meet the immigration rules to ensure the integrity of Canada’s immigration program” and that refugee claimants may appeal for “pre-removal risk assessment” before their deportation date. </p>

	<p>Hernandez is set to appear before Federal Court on Tuesday for her last chance at staying in Canada. </p>

	<p>“We always will be family and I just want the opportunity to stay close to my baby,” said Hernandez. “Because if I leave, maybe I will not see him again.” </p>

			<h3>Nine months after creating the positions, the Graduate Students’ Association finally filled the posts of VP Academic and Advocacy and VP Mobilization at a general assembly on Thursday.</h3>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

Software engineering student Shewetaank Indora easily defeated Mostapha Marzban, Alex Ilobuchi Ocheoha and Robert Sonin for the position of VP Academic and Advocacy in a show-of-hands vote.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Sonin, a philosophy student and former president of both the <span class="caps">GSA</span> and the labour union Teaching and Research Assistants at Concordia, won the much closer vote for VP Mobilization over Rohit Patil and Shide Salimi.</p>

	<p>Over a hundred <span class="caps">GSA</span> members—far more than the 63 required for quorum—crowded into the EV building auditorium for the vote, which was moved up to the top of the agenda. Still, some argued that the new executive positions are unnecessary, including current <span class="caps">GSA</span> President Mohit Sharma.</p>

	<p>“The roles and responsibilities for those [positions] are contradicting with the roles and responsibilities with other staff members’ positions,” Sharma told the assembly. </p>

	<p>He suggested, for example, that the VP External and hired staff members like the outreach and campaigns coordinators are already performing the tasks assigned to the VP Mobilization.</p>

	<p>“From my perspective, it’s a waste of money for you, for all of us students,” said Sharma.</p>

	<p>Nadia Hausfather, last year’s VP External for the <span class="caps">GSA</span>, disagreed. She had been on the Council of Directors when the decision was made to slash the <span class="caps">GSA</span> executive from seven members down to three, and in retrospect described it as an unsuccessful experiment. </p>

	<p>“In my experience, three executives is not enough for a student association the size of the <span class="caps">GSA</span>,” said Hausfather, who attended Thursday’s GA. “The graduate student association of [the Université de Sherbrooke] and the graduate student association of [Université Laval] have at least seven executives in addition to seven paid staff. </p>

	<p>“In terms of the staff,” she added, “the staff are different than executives because executives are elected to carry out a political vision, right? The staff does what the executives decide and what council decides.”</p>

	<p>Indora and Sonin will only get to keep their jobs for two months, until the GSA’s annual general elections in early April, when they may be eligible to run again.</p>

	<p>Last April, <span class="caps">GSA</span> members voted in a GA to increase the size of the student association’s executive committee by creating the two positions. </p>

	<p>Thursday’s long-awaited vote had been on the agenda at the GSA’s last GA in November—along with a motion put forth by the Council of Directors to abolish the new positions altogether—but these were ultimately postponed because of a lengthy budget debate and a loss of quorum.</p>

	<p>The proposal to abolish the positions was defeated at Thursday’s GA, and the election of the two executives then went ahead as planned—after which much of the crowd left.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless, enough stuck around to maintain quorum and continue with the other elections on the agenda, although there were few candidates. Firas Al Hammoud was the sole nominee for the available spot as the <span class="caps">GSA</span> representative on Concordia’s Senate—the university’s senior academic body—and was elected. Marilou Andrey (Fine Arts), Juliette Lees (Arts and Science) and Marie-Hélène Vanier (Arts and Science) were admitted to the Council of Directors by acclamation.</p>

	<p>The assembly lost quorum before getting to a number of other agenda points, including a motion regarding the GSA’s stance on the provincial government’s proposed Charter of Values.</p>

			<p><i>Faculty Association Seeks to Ensure Continued Access to Student Member List </i></p>

			<p>The Commerce and Administration Student Association is on its way to being accredited following an overwhelming show of support at the ballot box over the last two weeks.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Between Jan. 20 and Jan. 30, about 97 per cent of John Molson business students who voted did so in favour of accrediting the faculty association with the provincial government, with 2,373 students taking part in the vote, according to <span class="caps">CASA</span> VP Academic Loïc Sanscartier.</p>

	<p>That amounts to just under 40 per cent of all <span class="caps">JMSB</span> undergrads. At least 25 per cent voter turnout is needed for the vote to be recognized by the government.</p>

	<p>“It’s great to get such a positive response, it shows that [students] know what we’re doing as a student association and want us to continue what we’re doing,” said <span class="caps">CASA</span> President John-Michael Minon.</p>

	<p>With the vote, <span class="caps">CASA</span> is set to become the second faculty association granted status in the past two years. The Engineering and Computer Science Association received its accreditation in 2013 after it had previously lapsed. </p>

	<p>According to Minon and Sanscartier, who spearheaded the initiative, <span class="caps">CASA</span> sought accredited status as a precaution to ensure continued access to its student member list, which is obtained from the Dean of Students. </p>

	<p>Sanscartier added that being accredited also enables the association to continue renting out space for meetings and events.</p>

	<p>Although it legally does not have to, the university currently provides these resources to <span class="caps">CASA</span> and other non-accredited faculty associations. According to Sanscartier, accredited associations automatically “have the right to them by law.”</p>

	<p>“In that sense it is [preventative] policy,” he said.</p>

	<p>“In case anything happens in the future, in case the school decides to change its policy towards students associations—which you don’t want to be the case, but you never know—we have this accreditation to ensure we are continuing to work for <span class="caps">JMSB</span> students.”</p>

	<p>This is not the first time <span class="caps">CASA</span> has received accreditation. It first sought independence from the Concordia University Student Association—the predecessor to the current Concordia Student Union—in the late 1980s. </p>

	<p>Speaking to <em>The Link</em> at the time, 1987-1988 <span class="caps">CASA</span> President Derrick Ajmo indicated the public perception of <span class="caps">CUSA</span> as a radical liberal organization was “hampering [CASA’s] relationships outside the school.”</p>

	<p>In gaining accreditation status, Ajmo asserted it would be easier for <span class="caps">CASA</span> to present a “conservative image associated with a good business school.”</p>

	<p>Despite pushback from <span class="caps">CUSA</span>, <span class="caps">CASA</span> was accredited in 1989, losing its status in the early 2000s following restructuring.</p>

	<p>When the <span class="caps">CSU</span> was formed out of the ashes of <span class="caps">CUSA</span>, it also sought accreditation multiple times throughout the 1990s. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">CASA</span> and the <span class="caps">ECA</span> both opposed the CSU’s accreditation efforts in 1996, 1999 and 2000, but the undergraduate association finally voted in favour of accreditation in October 2000.</p>

	<p>According to Sanscartier, CASA’s latest bid for accreditation is in no way seeking to usurp any authority or powers from the <span class="caps">CSU</span>.</p>

	<p>Multiple <span class="caps">CSU</span> executives and councillors also lent their support to CASA’s accreditation campaign.</p>

	<p>The results of the vote are now being prepared and sent to the provincial government to be recognized, according to Minon.</p>

	<p>However, when the vote will actually be recognized remains unclear, he added, but from the response he has received from students the initiative is seen as worthwhile regardless.</p>

	<p>“It’s definitely super important to have as a faculty association,” Minon said. “It’s really important that we have the students’ voice being heard.”</p>

			<p><i>Student Bar Earns Quarterly Profit Before Closing for Renovations</i></p>

			<p>Closed indefinitely for renovations, Reggie’s bar has gone months without a single customer—but it’s still set to post its first yearly profit ever.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>“If Reggie’s doesn’t open between now and the end of the year, that would mean that this is the first [year] that Reggie’s is profitable ever in its history,” said <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp President Scott Carr at the company’s shareholder meeting last month. </p>

	<p>Reggie’s is managed by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp, the for-profit branch of the Concordia Student Union.</p>

	<p>Over the span of the two fiscal quarters, of which the bar was only open for the entire duration of one, Reggie’s garnered a $3,744 profit on $78,522 in revenues, according to <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp documents.</p>

	<p>That number may fluctuate by up to $2,000 but is expected to remain in the black if the student bar is not reopened.</p>

	<p>According to the Reggie’s bar website created over the winter holidays by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp staff to keep students up to date on the progress of renovations, <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp was originally founded to oversee the Reggie’s space in the aim of eventually turning a profit to offset the expenses of the CSU’s predecessor, the Concordia University Student Association. </p>

	<p>That was in 1984, and the bar has yet to actually post an operational profit over the duration of an academic year, according to Carr.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp closed Reggie’s in October for renovations and the bar was originally expected to reopen last month. Before that, the bar was open only between Wednesday and Saturday to curb operational expenses incurred from slow business days.</p>

	<p>However, <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp and the university’s Facilities Management department have yet to agree on the extent of the needed repairs and what falls under the university’s financial responsibility, and the bar’s reopening has been delayed indefinitely until construction can begin. </p>

	<p>An independent assessment was scheduled for last week, <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp chairperson James Tyler Vaccaro told <em>The Link</em> on Jan. 13. </p>

	<p>However, as of the beginning of February, Vaccaro says he is now expecting to receive the independent assessments starting Feb. 7.</p>

	<p>According to Concordia spokesperson Chris Mota, Facilities Management and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp representatives will be meeting Feb. 4 to collectively survey the space.</p>

	<p>“We’re going to be doing a walkthrough of the space to take a look at the issues of concern on our end,” said Vaccaro, which he says includes faulty plumbing and insulation issues that have prompted one independent inspection for asbestos in the space on Friday morning.</p>

	<p>Vaccaro added that while they don’t agree on the scope of issues plaguing the space, Facilities Management has been “open to addressing [CUSAcorp’s] concerns overall.”</p>

	<p>Carr, also the <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Finance, said both <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp and the <span class="caps">CSU</span> consider revamping the bar and making it a long-term success a higher priority than reopening for the sake of doing so.</p>

	<p>“Although we are proud to say that Reggie’s posted a profit in [quarters one and two of fiscal 2013-2014] our focus this year remains rebuilding an amazing space to serve students in the years to come,” Carr said.</p>

	<p>“Honestly, I get the question almost every single day: when will Reggie’s reopen? And I don’t think anyone wants it to reopen more than CUSAcorp’s board,” added Vaccaro.</p>

	<p>“We realize it is a valuable space on campus and I know [it’s a space] much used by students throughout the year as well.</p>

	<p>“Right now it’s really about figuring out all the problems that are in the space and coming to a common ground with the university […] and then moving forward on the project so we can come out with something that’s really beneficial to students,” he concluded.</p>

			<p>Construction on The Hive Café has not yet begun—but that’s not the only thing holding back progress on the project’s development. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The Concordia Student Union’s Referendum Oversight Committee is looking to fund the salary of a project manager who would oversee the creation of the co-operative board that would govern both the Hive and the student-run café that will replace the Hall Building Java U, according to the committee’s report on its meeting last month. </p>

	<p>Where to secure those funds remains undetermined, however. </p>

	<p>“An assessment of the CSU’s financial health as well as a breakdown of the bylaw interpretations will be presented at the next council meeting,” said <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Finance Scott Carr. </p>

	<p>Gabriel Velasco, an Arts and Science councillor and member of the Concordia Food Coalition, suggested at the <span class="caps">ROC</span> meeting that money from the Student Space, Accessible Education and Legal Contingency Fund be used to pay a project manager. </p>

	<p>But according to the <span class="caps">ROC</span> report, <span class="caps">CSU</span> Special Bylaw I states that the fund can only be used for the improvement of student space. Velasco says there’s still a chance it can be used to fund a project manager, however. </p>

	<p>“[The bylaw] is ambiguous,” Velasco told <em>The Link.</em> “It’s money that has been sitting there for a while. […] There are other options but that seems to be the most viable one.” </p>

	<p>“The bylaw empowers council to use the funds very broadly for ‘improvements to student space,’” added VP Sustainability Ben Prunty. “So the important question to ask then is: is a student café a student space? Of course it is. Is putting a co-operative into the mezzanine space considered an improvement to student space? Since students voted 9-1 in favour of putting a co-operative in there, I’d say it is pretty clear that they consider it an improvement.”  </p>

	<p>According to Carr, however, the funds will have to come from elsewhere. </p>

	<p>“The money from the <span class="caps">SSAELC</span> fund is not available for projects currently due to circumstances beyond the CSU’s control,” said Carr, who refused to specify what those circumstances are.  </p>

	<p>Other options discussed at the <span class="caps">ROC</span> meeting included accepting requests for proposals from established co-operatives to bid on the space and having the Arts and Science Federation of Associations fund the project, both of which came with their drawbacks.</p>

	<p>“ASFA, to my knowledge, does not have the funds necessary to fund this entire project,” said Carr. </p>

	<p>Meanwhile, “a co-operative that is run by students and already has existing capital would further limit the options presented,” states the <span class="caps">ROC</span> report on the option of accepting an <span class="caps">RFP</span>.  </p>

	<p><strong>A Co-operative Board</strong></p>

	<p>Prunty, a founding director of the <span class="caps">CFC</span> primarily in charge of governance for the Hive, introduced the idea of a shared governance structure between the two cafés to the committee, arguing that such a model would  help to reduce costs. The board would be composed of members of the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and the <span class="caps">CFC</span>, as well as other Concordia students.</p>

	<p>“Each [food outlet] would have its own proper management, but the opportunities lay in the fact that the Hive has its own kitchen, and so it could supply prepared food […] to other student-run locations around campus,” Prunty told <em>The Link.</em></p>

	<p>“This would help drive down costs, not only financially, but also in people-power, since each location would not need its own board of directors and [annual general meetings], and things like that really do require a lot of organization and commitment on the part of students.” </p>

	<p>One potential issue with such a structure brought up at the <span class="caps">ROC</span> meeting was the burden that would be placed on one café if the other was not financially sustainable, but despite this Prunty says a shared governance model “would be the ideal.” </p>

	<p>“A lot of the work done on the Hive already could be shared with the mezzanine co-operative,” he said, adding however that nothing is set in stone as council “has not deliberated on this particular option at length yet.”</p>

	<p>“Council will need to commit to one direction or the other so we can put resources behind [the project] and really start moving forward,” he said. </p>

			<p>Nestled in a nook along St. Laurent Blvd.’s main strip, with a bulky metal door adorned with a wreath of shattered Maplewood skateboard decks, the thrash-hold to <span class="caps">TRH</span>-Bar is pretty discrete from the outside.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>But once you’ve taken a few steps up the steep, dark staircase with graffiti-plastered walls and hear the whoosh and rumble of skaters shredding the bowl, and the odd hooting and hollering rising to a crescendo of cheers and deck-tapping applause after someone sticks a banger trick, you know you’ve found the right place.</p>

	<p>Sweat is palpable in the air upon entering, and beyond the Pabst Blue Ribbon-stacked bar and DJ booth is the core of the action—skaters whirling around the bowl surrounded by a rowdy crowd of onlookers, separated by a newly-installed wire fence and a loose mesh net reminiscent of a baseball game, there to catch unruly runaway boards rather than foul balls.</p>

	<p>The bitter cold of winter has no power in this urban jungle—here, skateboarding is king.</p>

	<p>Montreal’s premiere skateboarding bar, <span class="caps">TRH</span>-Bar (pronounced “Trash-Bar”) has only been open since April of last year, but has already become a hub of the Montreal skateboarding community. The main attraction is the newly remodeled wooden bowl on the first floor, situated in the centre of the complex, but a second level reveals a four-foot polyboard mini-halfpipe, a secondary bar, and a stage for bands and DJs.</p>

	<p>The average first reaction to a skatepark/bar hybrid is one of shock and disbelief—how can insurance cover such a volatile mix of extreme sports, cheap alcohol and wild skateboarders?</p>

	<p>Bar founders Fred Vitu and Joe Valina said it wasn’t easy—it took months to arrange the correct permits and secure insurance, coming from an unspecified foreign country. Finding the right location proved challenging as well.</p>

	<p>“We were working for a year looking around. We were driving together all over Montreal to find the right place, making phone calls,” Vitu said.</p>

	<p>The only known precedent to their skate project is alternative bar and venue Foufounes Electriques that once featured a mini-ramp, but the bar was forced to remove it due to lack of proper insurance.</p>

	<p>“Before we tried to find the location, we had to find the insurance because of the Foufounes trouble. […] It took a long time to find it, but as soon as we had it, then we went forward,” Vitu said.</p>

	<p>Even with the proper paperwork lined up, the skate bar still receives funny looks from some—most notably Montreal police.</p>

	<p>“The cops, they don’t like us too much. Since the beginning, they’ve been coming a lot,” Vitu said.</p>

	<p>As for the bar’s abbreviated name, Vitu said that was less an aesthetic choice than one forced upon him and Valina by the Quebec language police.</p>

	<p>“Because of the <em>Office de la langue française</em>, we couldn’t call it ‘Trash Bar,’ so, in French, ‘T-R-H,’ when you say it, it [sounds like] ‘Trash,’” he explained.</p>

	<p><strong>New Bowl, New Blood</strong></p>

	<p><span class="caps">TRH</span>-Bar’s original bowl was constructed free of charge by a friend of Vitu and Valina’s last year, and was quickly covered in a sleeve of colourful spray paint artwork and skated on for months.</p>

	<p>But the integrity of the ramp was eventually compromised. Air pockets in the wood sent cracks spiraling through stressed areas, and the extension of the bowl (the higher-raised end that reaches a vertical degree) became haggard and difficult to skate on.</p>

	<p>With the bar’s popularity taking off and sponsorships from companies such as Jagermeister and Pabst Brewing Company bringing in funds, Vitu was recently able to demolish the old bowl and build a new one from scratch.</p>

	<p>“The skaters say, ‘Oh, that’s a shitty bowl,’ so let’s re-do the bowl. We’re here for them,” Vitu said.</p>

	<p>Former professional skateboarder, events coordinator and Montreal native Eric Mercier signed on for the job of designing and constructing the new bowl. With 29 years of skateboarding under his belt and having built skateparks such as Montreal’s 83,000 square-foot indoor park Le Taz, <span class="caps">TRH</span>-Bar’s new bowl was an ideal endeavour.</p>

	<p>“[The new bowl] is a better design, definitely. The materials are all the same, but if they’re not installed properly, they become shit,” Mercier said.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">TRH</span>-Bar held a launch for the new skate structure on Feb. 1, just three weeks after the initial demolition of the old bowl. The new bowl is larger, infinitely smoother and better designed than its predecessor. Just one revolution pumping around the corners can reap a massive boost of speed, and skaters can grind for much longer around the coping, producing more satisfying tricks—but also cringe-worthy high-speed slams.</p>

	<p>At the launch, skaters were hungry to get tricks or die trying. There were multiple collisions as eager skaters dropped in at the same time, and daring photographers lurked at the edge of the bowl or even jumped in to snap a photo of elusive aerial tricks in the deep extension.</p>

	<p>Skaters brought their A-game for the best trick contest, with wall plants, big airs and steezy stalls going down all night—a sign of all the shredding still to come.</p>

					<p><strong>The Misfits and the Rebels</strong></p>

	<p>Vitu moved here from Soissons, France 10 years ago and hasn’t looked back since. For him, Montreal was the perfect place to realize his dream of owning a skate bar.</p>

	<p>“It’s a great city—I’ve been travelling a bit around the world, and I love what’s happening here. I think it’s the best place to do this project,” he said.</p>

	<p>Mercier agrees that <span class="caps">TRH</span>-Bar is highly unique, which perhaps explains why it’s already become a staple in the city’s skate scene.</p>

	<p>“The concept is good—everyone goes out anyways, and in the wintertime at least you have the ramp to skate, so why not combine the two together?” he said. “The guys saw an opportunity to open a skate bar, with a bowl and a ramp. It’s a perfect combo for success, for the skate side of the bar scene.”</p>

	<p>The bar has been host to a wide range of events. Professional skateboarders from around the world have visited, such as rising star Torey Pudwill and the legendary Chico Brenes. Skate videos have held their Montreal premieres at <span class="caps">TRH</span>, including Emerica’s latest video <em>Made</em>, along with music shows and more.</p>

	<p>“We are always open for anybody to make an event here, whether a party, or film premiere or fashion show. Anything you want, you can do it here,” Vitu said.</p>

	<p>“We’ve also had a harp player in the bar. […] She was playing harp, and there was graffiti [painting] at the same time and breakdancing.”</p>

	<p>Vitu says <span class="caps">TRH</span>-Bar is a no-judgment zone as well—all are welcome to drink, shred, party and have a good time.</p>

	<p>“[We] don’t judge about tattoos, or hairstyle, or dressing style or stuff like that. You can come wearing a shirt and a tie or a dress or be all dirty; we don’t care,” he said. “As long as you respect the people next to you, it’s perfect, you’re welcome in the bar.”</p>

	<p>Vitu says first-timers at <span class="caps">TRH</span> are often taken aback by the total immersion in skate culture, with walls layered in graffiti, skate decks hung up and even built into the very integrity of the bar’s surface, skate videos constantly playing on screens everywhere, and of course the ramps themselves—it’s a skatopia dream finally realized.</p>

	<p>“Everytime you see a new person coming in the bar, you just have to see his face, just see the surprise,” said Vitu. “I don’t know what you can expect. Don’t expect to have a really clean couch, or the best champagne to drink, or a fancy cocktail.</p>

	<p>“Don’t come for that. Come for everything else.”</p>

			<p><i>Montreal Dance Company Stages Production to Help Prevent Youth Violence</i></p>

			<p>More than once in rehearsal, emotion has gotten the better of the dancers in Sonia Balazovjech’s company. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>For their latest production, the dancers in the non-profit company have linked up with the youth violence prevention program LOVE—an acronym for Leave Out ViolencE—to bring attention to the challenges facing youth, from bullying to drug abuse.</p>

	<p>“Some pieces get so intense we all end up crying,” said Lindsey Haywood, a member of the Sonia Balazovjech Dance Company since 2010. “We’re looking at each other, remembering Grade 6 when other girls were so mean to you, and called you ugly, brace-face and four eyes.</p>

	<p>“For the moment, you have to stay in character to make sure your message comes across as genuine as possible.”</p>

	<p>Founder of the company, Sonia Balazovjech, and her fellow dancers, who are trained in contemporary and classical styles, want audiences to walk away from their performance with a deep impression.</p>

	<p>“We really want it to be an experience for them rather than just a show,” she said. “We always felt that if an audience comes and watches the show, claps and leaves, our message is lost. But if they come and we teach them something, it’ll have a longer lasting effect.”</p>

	<p>In the past, the dance company has donated all proceeds from their shows to other local charities, including the West Island Women’s Shelter, 60 Million Girls foundation, and St. Mary’s Hospital Foundation. Balazovjech says her company’s new partnership with <span class="caps">LOVE</span> is a natural fit.</p>

	<p>“The concern that I had [to prevent youth violence] just kept brewing, until I was like, ‘Okay, we’ve got to do something with this cause,’” she said.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">LOVE</span> debuted in Montreal just over 17 years ago. Sheila “Twinkle” Rudberg founded the program after her husband, Daniel, tried to stop a 14-year-old from mugging an elderly woman and was fatally stabbed.</p>

	<p>The incident led Rudberg to launch an organization to curb youth violence and crime. <span class="caps">LOVE</span> got its start in a class of 15 students in a Dawson College <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> photography course and has since expanded to other Canadian cities and abroad.</p>

	<p>Using spoken word poetry, journal writing and photography, volunteers for the organization teach non-violence to middle and high school students.</p>

	<p>In its production “Addicted to <span class="caps">LOVE</span>,” Balazovjech’s dance company is out to show that the social ills that the organization was founded to address persist today—and that there are solutions.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">SBDC</span> and its technical director, Robert Lynch, found inspiration for the show leafing through a collection of <span class="caps">LOVE</span> students’ poetry, photography and journal entries. The booklet has been passed around among the company so much that it is creased and dog-eared.</p>

	<p>“It’s a very emotional show. We really wanted to get behind the psyche of what kids are dealing with on a daily basis,” said Balazovjech. “It’s such a fast-paced world now, and there are so many pressures.”</p>

	<p>The dancers conveyed the students’ experiences of physical and verbal abuse, addiction, and depression into movement. A year-and-a-half in the making, the show is the product of a collaborative process. </p>

	<p>Each dancer had input in the show’s conception, from choreography to music. The songs in the performance range from Patrick Watson to live music by local hip-hop producer and MC David Hodges and folk singer Stefanie Parnell.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">SBDC</span> will take the stage just a few feet away from the audience to try to convey the piece’s highs and lows in intimate detail.</p>

	<p>Many of the dancers in the company come from a gymnastics background so there is no shortage of acrobatics in the performance. But, for <span class="caps">SBDC</span>, expression takes precedence over technique.</p>

	<p>“Some pieces are very technical, but we have a few pieces where we throw the dance moves out the window. It’s like acting,” said <span class="caps">SBDC</span> dancer Dawn Patulli, who graduated from Concordia’s John Molson School of Business in December.</p>

	<p>The opening of the 90-minute show focuses on the difficulties facing youth. The second half is more hopeful, beginning with a sequence in which the dancers form a line-up in front of a mirror. Strapped to elastics symbolizing love and organization in the community, Petulli breaks down the wall.</p>

	<p>“That’s really the first piece in the show with that uplifting, soul[ful] feeling where we’re really starting to reach for hope—which is what <span class="caps">LOVE</span> signifies through the show,” she said. <br />
“Through <span class="caps">LOVE</span> [troubled youth] can get past whatever they’re going through and [we can] help them in the right direction.”</p>

	<p>Addicted to <span class="caps">LOVE</span> // Feb. 7 and Feb. 8 // Espace Reunion (6600 Hutchison St.) // 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. // $20 students with valid ID, $37 regular advance</p>
