This was especially the case when delegates were expected to sit through <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/misc/sites/mcgill.ca.misc/files/programme_final_0.pdf">presentations</a> by people who only serve to manufacture debate (and in some cases outright fallacies) that stops necessary climate and human rights action from happening.</p>
<p><a href="http://divestmcgill.com">Divest McGill</a> did walk out on Ezra Levant after the first three to four minutes of his talk when he reduced all female activists into one sexist denominator, without making any points on the intended topic. Liz Hannah, the Vice-President of Communications at Cenovus Energy, was given the stage for a full 30 minutes. In comparison, Katherine Koostachin and Janelle Baker, two of the few aboriginal voices in the days’ program, had about ten each, and grassroots voices had no speaking time whatsoever. Despite the polite exterior, the extent of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWrNzyTHO7M&amp;list=PLs5Izv4r1bTD9yr9EYyY4P2r6n-_pzmA8&amp;index=5">propaganda</a> Hannah pushed on us was chilling. While many laughed in scorn at Levant, dead silence pervaded the room when Hannah gave her monologue, likely because of the danger of the type of mindset that she, as a corporate fossil fuel representative, was propagating in our midst.</p>

<p>In 1988, the <a href="http://www.cmos.ca/ChangingAtmosphere1988e.pdf">World Meteorological Organization declared</a> that human-made emissions of atmospheric pollutants are a “globally pervasive experiment whose ultimate consequences [...] represent a major threat to international security and are already having harmful consequences over many parts of the globe.” They predicted “severe economic and social dislocation for present and future generations” and stated “it is imperative to act now.” It’s been over 25 years since that call to action, and the increasingly terrifying effects of society’s addiction to fossil fuels are happening right now. <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/docs/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf">Consensus</a> on the dangers of climate change, as well as the imperative to stop dumping carbon into our atmosphere, is stronger than ever, and yet meaningful action has been slow to materialize. Why?</p>
<p>The few interests who will profit financially from fossil fuel exploitation in the short term have worked to <a href="http://polarisinstitute.org/files/BigOil%27sOilyGrasp_0.pdf">undermine our democracy</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/14/funding-climate-change-denial-thinktanks-network">manufacture debate on climate change</a>, when the science is clearly settled. To suggest that we should continue expanding the fossil fuel industry is, quite frankly, a flawed business plan at odds with our very survival. It is even more imperative for us to act now than it was 25 years ago, and yet we’re still stuck on the debate of whether we should keep using our atmosphere as a dump for greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change.</p>
<p>This is why it was extremely concerning to see the legitimizing platforms provided to fossil fuel proponents at Petrocultures. When <a href="http://math.350.org">60 to 80 per cent of current fossil reserves must remain unburned</a> to keep the globe within 2 degrees Celsius of further warming, it is clear that a transition to a low-carbon future is both positive and necessary. Thus, it is incredibly frustrating to hear people arguing for continued exploitation of fossil fuels, of our environment, and of people who are on the front lines of extraction projects and the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Despite many moments of frustration, I am ultimately glad that I was able to attend Petrocultures, and that <a href="http://www.forgetthebox.net/petrocultures-2014-conference/">Divest McGill</a> had a <a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/02/mcgill-students-speak-out-against-fossil-fuel-extraction/">strong presence</a> there. I overheard someone wearing our button saying that our spirit was infectious, and there were lots of <a href="https://twitter.com/DivestMcGill">tweets</a> congratulating the group on &#8220;keeping it real&#8221; with our &#8220;tenacious, smart and witty interventions.&#8221; It seems we were fairly successful in our aim of shifting the discourse towards questions more constructive than: &#8220;Are we a petroculture?”</p>

<p>I would say that we gained allies, with many delegates coming to thank us for our work and inquire about our campaign. Some of the speakers also verbally endorsed us while wearing our buttons. Stephanie Lemenager and Darin Barney were among our supporters, and Tzeporah Berman gave a particularly strong call to action:</p>
<p>“Divestment is no longer a fringe idea. When store brands announced that they were going to divest $74 billion from coal last year it became an entirely different ball game […] The responsibility of academic institutions is to help build leadership, to build the world to come, to educate. How are we preparing our students for the future if we are unwilling to lead? I support the divestment movement here at McGill. I urge McGill to ensure divestment. It’s only 5 per cent of your holdings. You can do it, and should do it.”</p>
<p>Overall, the <a href="http://lockoutpetrocultures.wordpress.com">#LockOutPetrocultures</a> action (unaffiliated with, but supported by Divest McGill), as well as our own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1402801959973076/?fref=ts">#NotreFutur</a> rally outside the conference and active questioning inside of it, played essential roles in bringing the dialogue back to what we really need to focus on: not whether fossil fuel extraction is a problem, but how we can <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/5468">work toward solving</a> one of the most urgent challenges of our generation. I am grateful to all those who not only remember what&#8217;s at stake in this struggle, but help us all keep a clear sense of purpose in the face of what can seem like overwhelming challenges. Now let&#8217;s start turning dialogue into <a href="http://divestmcgill.com/petition/">concrete action</a> to push for systemic change!</p>

Throughout the workshop, Louw and Tshuma encouraged participants to share their experiences with and personal views on accessibility.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Disability is viewed as a problem and it’s viewed in individualistic terms, not in terms of let’s try to make our community open and accessible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After participants discussed their perceptions of accessibility and disability, Louw and Tschuma showed a video of Tshuma and his friend during a practice fire evacuation at Concordia University. Tshuma was waiting for a fireman to help him evacuate the building, as he could not access the stairs in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>“That was a pretty scary situation since I was waiting for 45 minutes on the eleventh floor, and everybody else had evacuated the building,” Tshuma told The Daily. “You are less important of a student for the Concordia faculty. That’s how it was like. It’s kind of scary because the whole point of the institution is to take care of student needs.”</p>
<p>Louw also asked the participants to voice their opinions on possible ways to build a movement around accessibility, as methods such as protests and street blockades pose barriers to those who cannot “[use their bodies] as a weapon.”</p>
<p>Some participants suggested spreading personal stories and information about the challenges of accessibility in Montreal. “I feel like unless you know someone, are close to someone, or work with people who have challenges with accessibility, it’s not on your mind. So maybe in [… Montreal], awareness might be the first step […] Just to get people thinking about it [and] talking about it,” said a participant.</p>
<p>The workshop concluded with an announcement about Accessibilize Montreal’s “Strateg-Tea” meeting on February 25 that will mainly discuss strategies to spread awareness on the movement for accessibility in Montreal.</p>
<p>“Disability is viewed as a problem and it’s viewed in individualistic terms, not in terms of let’s try to make our community open and accessible,” stated Louw. “It seems like there’s a cultural shift [in the meaning of disability] that’s needed in order to make things work.”</p>

<p>The event looked at the reality in Spain following the collapse of the real estate bubble and the current economic and social crisis. Squatting is defined as taking residence in an unoccupied or abandoned building (usually residential). Squatters do not have legal permission to occupy the space.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The unemployment rate for the general population is 25.8 per cent and for people under 25, the unemployment rate is 54.3 per cent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Enrique Llanes, who has been a squatter for more than five years in the United Kingdom and Spain, “90 per cent of squatters do not choose this life by choice, it is a necessity.”</p>
<p>Spain has been facing a housing crisis since the collapse of the real estate bubble in 2008.</p>
<p>“In 2007 there were more than 420,000 foreclosures and around 220,000 evictions of families.” Carol Galais, a member of the Collectifs, explained. “In 2012, every 15 minutes, a family lost their home in Spain due to foreclosures.”</p>
<p>According to Galais, since 2002, the Spanish government and banks have been encouraging housing construction as a means to boost the economy.</p>
<p>Veronica Crespo, another member of the Collectifs, continued, “Spanish banks gave out loans irresponsibly during this period. The loans covered 80 per cent to 100 per cent of the total cost of the home. At the height of the construction boom, 750,000 homes were built [per] year and yet no one believed that there was a real estate bubble […] until the burst in 2008”.</p>
<p>“The unemployment rate for the general population is 25.8 per cent and for people under 25, the unemployment rate is 54.3 per cent,” Crespo added.</p>
<p>The European Union has classified Spanish mortgage laws as a violation of consumer-protection rules. Currently, 13 to 15 per cent of homes are unoccupied in Spain. In response to increasing suicides of evicted homeowners, the Spanish government issued a two-year moratorium on evictions.</p>
<p>According to the presenters, housing is not considered a human right in Spain. In Canada, there have been efforts to push the government to enact adequate housing as a human right. In 2012, Bill C-400 was introduced to ensure secure, adequate, accessible, and affordable housing for Canadians. However, this bill failed to pass in February 2013.</p>

With a flare for flawlessness, they ambitiously undertook this iconic production, which they carefully chose to reflect the world we live in today. In Gilbert and Sullivan’s world of hierarchical monotony, the struggle to abide by the rules or follow our convictions evidences how feeble our collective mentality can be. In <em>The Mikado</em>, the McGill Savoy Society shows just how hard it can be to think for yourself when you’re surrounded by the norms that society constantly reinforces.</p>
<p><em>The Mikado</em>, a comic opera, is set in Japan. The choice of locale was made in order to covertly satirize British politics by disguising them as Japanese, as well as to poke fun at the Victorian fascination with Orientalism. Nanki-Poo (John Cook/Gabriel Campagne), the main character, a free spirit and musician who is repeatedly reminded of his lower social status throughout the play. He is courting the young and beautiful Yum-Yum (Dallas Chorley/Allegra Johnston), who is set – to Nanki-Poo’s dismay – to marry a high official, Ko-Ko (Nathaniel Hanula-James/Scott Cope).</p>
<p>Yum-Yum and her vain friends are essentially ‘flakes’ who relish all the attention they get. But while <em>The Mikado’</em>s younger characters tend toward the vapid, the older folks like Ko-Ko, the high-placed politician Pish-Tush (Michael Loewen), and the serious power tripper Pooh-Bah (Jonah Spungin) highly enjoy all the bowing, formalities, and extended conversations about their own importance. This medley of vacuous characters could hardly be called a winning combination for a progressive society.</p>
<p>Throughout the production, <em>The Mikado</em> keeps asking these questions we often hear about our own society in a fresh way. The women Gilbert and Sullivan portray are the end prize for the male characters, the members of the lower classes are strung along, and the important people make all their decisions based on loathing and self-interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps what makes this production brilliant is the adroitness the Savoy Society shows in keeping heavy issues lighthearted, in a way Gilbert and Sullivan themselves would have been delighted to witness. &#8220;It&#8217;s an enjoyable political satire,” points out the director, Cameron MacLeod. “There are storylines of seeking acceptance and finding love that are very human.&#8221; <em>The Mikado</em> serves as a hilarious and on-point satire, and a perceptive audience can savour the critique on multiple levels. <em>The Mikado</em>’s message still rings true, even in this mystical world of top hats and silk robes. The Savoy Society exposes our inability to escape our failings, showing us the tragic ease with which we give credit to the young, beautiful, and wealthy, even when no credit is due; just as we suffer the poisonous consequences of the self interest of politicians.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The Mikado</em> is on February 20 to 22 at 7:30 p.m., and February 22 at 2:00 p.m., at Moyse Hall (853 Sherbrooke W.). Tickets are $12 for students.</p>

Lily Hoffman, a member of the UGE, explained, “We want to promote a more open and tolerant attitude toward sex and sexuality [...] I personally feel that at McGill most conversations about sex are superficial and that there are substantial lacks of knowledge about less conventional sex practices, and trans* and intersex people.” Rad Sex Week is intended to change the attitudes of students toward sexuality and create an in-depth discussion about sexual diversity.</p>
<p>Rad Sex Week is a well-established highlight of the UGE’s and Queer McGill’s activities. The aim of both groups is to enhance the position of women, queer, trans* and intersex people, and to encourage an open conversation on campus. In addition to being home to different working groups, the organizations offer an alternative library, as well as alternative contraception and menstruation products available by donation. During the Rad Sex Week, they work with external partners – including Stella, l’amie de Maimie (an organization representing and supporting sex workers), two Montreal-based drag artists, the Alternative Lifestyles Community Centre, and sexual health educators involved in the Sense Project and Head &#038; Hands – in order to reach a broader audience. On Monday, Clinic L’Actuel will set up HIV tests and be ready to answer questions about sexual health.   </p>
<p>The workshops will deal with the political aspects of sex, romance, and different conceptions of intimate relationships, and address questions around sex and safety issues in general. They offer an open and non-judgmental environment for trans* people to discuss shared concerns, and attempt to offer an insight into drag to interested people. Intersexuality and where that fits in our conventional understanding of sexuality is another topic treated during the week. Some of the more hands-on events give an introduction to erotic practices like kink, waxing, and bondage. The Slippery Slope Cabaret on Thursday will be a highlight, according to Sabine Grutter, Resource Coordinator at Queer McGill. As stated on the Facebook event page, the play will be a “sexy and provocative animal-themed extravaganza of burlesque, drag, and sex-positive performance” looking at conservative societal attitudes and fears toward everything that is not heterosexually monogamous. </p>
<p>All workshops will be held in English, with the exception of “Intersex Realities,” which offers the option of whisper translation. The locations are spread over the McGill downtown campus and are mostly wheelchair accessible.  </p>

<p>We, as current students and alumni of the McGill School of Social Work, are writing to express our support for Ou Jin Edward Lee, a doctoral student at the School of Social Work. Recently, Ed Lee <a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/10/mcgill-school-of-social-work-accused-of-perpetuating-systemic-racism/">filed a Human Rights Complaint</a> against McGill and the School of Social Work alleging racial discrimination in their latest hiring practices.</p>
<p>As students, we are greatly invested in our social work education, and care a great deal about the education and social work programming provided to future McGill students. It came with great disappointment that Ed was neither short-listed nor hired for one of the positions of part-time faculty lecturer posted and filled in Spring of 2013. We feel that as a current course lecturer, Ed has demonstrated his abilities as a dynamic, knowledgeable, invested, compassionate lecturer and educator to many students within the School. Ed has guided many students through one of the most theoretically and practically challenging courses offered within the School of Social Work, SWRK 325: Anti-Oppressive Practice. Not only has Ed demonstrated this through many years of teaching this course at both the Qualifying-Year and Bachelor levels, but he has also compassionately navigated space outside our classrooms to further explore topics and issues raised from the course.</p>
<p>Outside the classroom, Ed has demonstrated his commitment to the development of inclusive and conscientious community life within the School, providing professional guidance and support to many students. Ed has particularly reached out to those from minority and racialized backgrounds as they navigate the difficult systems of McGill. Additionally, after being nominated by students and community members, Ed was awarded the McGill Award for Equity and Community Building in March 2013, further demonstrating his outstanding work and commitment to advancing equity and diversity within the McGill community. We, as students, were proud to nominate Ed as a means of acknowledging his great contributions to our educational environment.</p>
<p>As students in the School, we believe that having our social work education representative of, influenced by, and guided by diverse faculty, staff, students, and community members is essential to our becoming conscientious, compassionate human-rights and social-justice-oriented social workers.</p>
<p>To encourage this, we would like to see a greater diversity of staff being hired; this includes specifically working to hire from historically underrepresented backgrounds, and people belonging to minority groups. Further, we strongly recommend that the School of Social Work adopt, and fully integrate, equitable hiring practices, seeking to encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds in order to provide long-term changes to the staff and structure of the School.</p>
<p>In doing so, we can ensure the voices of students participating in McGill’s Social Work program are better represented, while also providing students from marginalized and racialized backgrounds with professional and academic support at the faculty and administrative levels. Finally, we believe that providing such diversity is essential in our ability as social workers to truly ‘walk the talk’ and provide an environment at our university that models the world we strive to help create daily.</p>
<p>In light of the recent Human Rights Complaint, we stand with Ed, expressing our solidarity and our encouragement. We recognize that Ed’s compassion and commitment is continuously making the School of Social Work a more inclusive, representative, and social-justice-focused community – and a better place for social work learning. We strongly recommend that the McGill School of Social Work develop and truly implement a formal, publicly-published policy that leads to the integration of necessary changes to ensure diversity and representation within the school, at the faculty, and at all administrative levels.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Current Students and Alumni of the McGill School of Social Work</p>

<h3>Amendment to the Equity Policy</h3>
<p>The first motion concerned the AUS Equity Committee. The motion aimed to amend the AUS Equity Policy so that when Equity Officers attend AUS-affiliated events, including student orientation activities, it would not be at the expense of the Officers.</p>
<p>“Because it is the Equity Committee’s first year in existence, there [are] a lot of things that just needed to be sorted out in the bylaws. A lot of things didn’t really make sense in terms of implementation. So the goal of this was to be able to institute the things that the Equity Committee is supposed to be doing,” said AUS Equity Commissioner Hannah Sinclair in an interview with The Daily.</p>
<p>“It’s not fair to make someone pay $100 for Frosh, if they are going there in an official capacity,” Sinclair added.</p>
<p>AUS Equity Commissioner Josh Falek told The Daily that the lack of institutional support for equity during orientation week activities proved to be problematic, citing the fact that Equity Officers could not find out whether they could go to Frosh until two days before as evidence.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that when the future administrations come through, Equity Officers can still go to all these events,” Falek said.</p>
<p>The motion was passed with four abstentions.</p>
<h3>Standing committee endorsements during elections</h3>
<p>AUS McGill Environment Council (AUSec) representative Maggie Cascadden brought forth an issue concerning endorsement of candidates by standing committees.</p>
<p>“AUSec just wanted to have this discussion to discuss whether or not it’s possible for different departments [...] to endorse candidates in any of the upcoming elections,” Cascadden explained to the Council.</p>
<p>According to AUS electoral bylaws, departmental associations may be allowed to endorse candidates through their mailing lists; however, at the time of the discussion, there was no specific bylaw regarding standing committees like AUSec.</p>
<p>AUS VP External Kareem Ibrahim expressed concern over the idea. “As a faculty association, I don’t think it’s the best idea to address candidates, especially given that there will be a lot of bias involved in it,” Ibrahim explained.</p>
<p>“We should try to avoid becoming so politicized in such a small network that is McGill campus,” added AUS VP Events Paul Laughlin.</p>
<p>“I think there is a certain merit to endorsements considering that our communities are supposed to represent student interests, and there might be situations in which certain candidates may be more into these interests,” AUS VP Internal Enbal Singer said to the Council.</p>
<p>Cascadden later explained to the Council that the reason she brought up the issue was because AUSec wanted to endorse candidates based on their environmental platforms.</p>
<p>After the discussion, Cascadden and Singer drafted a motion to amend the AUS electoral bylaws to state that standing committees are able to publicly endorse candidates in AUS elections.</p>
<p>In an email to The Daily, AUS President Justin Fletcher said, “I think it’s a good idea that some of our committees have a guaranteed ability in our bylaws to endorse candidates on matters pertinent to their portfolio’s mandate.”</p>
<p>“However, as with any endorsements, they must exercise caution and ensure that the endorsement is decided on in a fair manner, as endorsements can send a strong message to candidates and to the AUS membership,” added Fletcher.</p>
<p>The motion was adopted with four votes against and two abstentions.</p>
<p>The other motions passed included the adoption of the revised constitution of the McGill Psychology Students’ Association, an amendment to the Arts Undergraduate Improvement Fund Bylaws, and the adoption of the budget of the Arts Computer Lab Fund Committee.</p>
<p>The motion regarding the adoption of an ethical purchasing policy was tabled due to the absence of AUS VP Finance Samuel Higgs, and will be discussed at the next Council meeting on February 19</p>

<h3>Council approves Midnight Kitchen referendum question</h3>
<p>McGill Graduate Association of Political Studies Students representative Lorenzo Daieff presented a motion at Council to include a question in PGSS’s upcoming referendum regarding a fee levy for Midnight Kitchen. The proposed opt-outable fee would be $0.50 per student per semester, a lower fee compared to the undergraduate fee of $3.25.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney noted that PGSS already makes yearly transfers to SSMU for the usage of SSMU’s building and services by PGSS members. A representative from Midnight Kitchen responded that Midnight Kitchen does not have access to that money and is funded exclusively by student fees. Some confusion arose over the purpose of this transfer.</p>
<p>The motion passed with around ten votes against, and the question will be in the upcoming referendum period.</p>
<h3>New application system for grads</h3>
<p>To mitigate the costs of uApply, a new graduate applications system that will be ready for the Summer 2014 term, Council voted to include a question in the upcoming PGSS referendum to increase the current graduate application fee for all new applicants to $120.</p>
<p>uApply costs $5 million to develop and will require $320,000 in maintenance and support over the coming years, according to the motion submitted to Council. Mark Quinsey from uApply pointed to several benefits of the new system, including ease of document submission, electronic reference letters, and more communication with applicants, among other things.</p>
<p>According to Martin Kreiswirth, Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies and Associate Provost (Graduate Education), McGill did a survey in 2008-09 to find out the reasons why students didn’t come to McGill. One of the reasons was that “it took too long [for students] to get their offer.”</p>
<p>Application fees will also be eliminated for students who ‘fast-track’ to a PhD without completing their Masters degree. However, students who get a PhD separately, or those in the qualifying year of their Masters, will still have to pay a fee.</p>
<h3>Funding allocation process too burdensome, associations say</h3>
<p>Hanno Erythropel, Chemical Engineering representative, brought up concerns about “stricter rules” surrounding the funding process for PGSAs. Currently, all events must be approved by the PGSS before funding is granted, which has become increasingly burdensome for the associations, according to several different Council members.</p>
<p>Mooney explained that this process has been put in place because PGSS has unlimited liability for any of the actions of the PGSAs, and so they had been legally recommended to pre-approve all expenditures and events. This is due to a memorandum of agreement (MOA) signed with the McGill administration in 2012 and set to expire in 2016.</p>
<p>Ge Sa, Mining and Materials Engineering representative, brought up the possibility of incorporating a student association independently so that it could manage its own fees. Deputy Provost (Student Life and Learning) Ollivier Dyens noted that, while indeed possible, this would impose a heavy administrative burden.</p>
<p>Dyens added that negotiations for a new MOA regarding fee management were underway, but that PGSS and the University had yet to come to an agreement.</p>
<h3>Fees reallocated due to changing needs</h3>
<p>Council also adopted a new fee structure for PGSS, which did not increase the total amount of fees paid but reallocated the money. The changes were split into three separate motions, with the first addressing the need for a $1.51 increase per student, per semester for the PGSS Regular Membership Fee.</p>
<p>Mooney explained that the increase was due to negotiations between PGSS and McGill over a new lease for Thomson House, which McGill owns. “One of the things that will change between the current lease and the one that we will sign would be that we would be responsible for paying a portion of the utilities cost. [... However] we have the Sustainable Thomson House initiative, and we plan to make upgrades to Thomson House to make it more sustainable and consume less energy.”</p>
<p>The PGSS Grants Program saw an increase of 81 cents, per student per semester while the fee for the Needs Based Bursary Fund decreased to $1.01 to reflect a shift to an endowment fund.</p>
<p>Council also approved a referendum question regarding the renewal of the PGSS Health and Dental Plan and a referendum question asking for a non-optoutable fee of $3 for the Athletics Building Improvement Fund, which will go to toward a turf improvement project on the McTavish reservoir.</p>
<p>Council additionally endorsed the proposed PGSS member code of conduct and harassment policy, and a proposal from the University and the Library that the McLennan Redpath Terrace be smoke-free.</p>

The language we speak outlines our culture and heritage while helping us create a powerful sense of self. February 21 is International Mother Language Day, a day that should serve as a reminder of the rich variety of mother tongues across the world. However, February 21 isn&#8217;t only a day to cherish the language you spoke as a child. It&#8217;s also a day that commemorates the struggle for language rights in many places, such as Bangladesh, where conflict over language inspired the creation of the International Mother Language Day in the first place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The significance of February 21 dates back to 1948 when then-president Muhammad Ali Jinnah declared Pakistan&#8217;s language to be Urdu, a minority language spoken mostly by the elite in West Pakistan. The people in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) responded to the military administration&#8217;s enforcement of the ruling by starting what later became known as the Bangla Language Movement. On February 21, 1952, demonstrators at Dhaka University protested the ‘Urdu only policy&#8217; and demanded that the government recognize Bangla as one of the official languages. The police fired bullets to try and halt the protest, killing several students and activists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In November 1999, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) officially recognized February 21 as the International Mother Language Day to raise awareness of linguistic diversity. Since then, several countries around the world have started to celebrate the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But the idea behind International Mother Language Day shouldn&#8217;t only resonate with Bangladeshis. In a multilingual country like Canada, language is a central component of many people&#8217;s identity. Over 20 per cent of all Canadians, and 30 per cent of McGill students, speak a first language that is neither English nor French. The Official Languages Act of 1969, heavily amended in 1988, enshrine Canadian bilingualism into law and is – at least in part – meant to support French-speaking and English-speaking minorities in different parts of the country. Despite this, a 2004 report found that only 86 per cent of &#8216;bilingual&#8217; posts in the federal public service were actually occupied by people who had mastered both languages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, according to a 2011 census, over 60 Indigenous languages are spoken in Canada. These Indigenous languages have little or no official recognition and support, and are often at risk of extinction. In fact, a recent report from UNESCO lists 88 of Canada&#8217;s Indigenous languages as critically close to becoming extinct. The agency estimates that these 88 languages will disappear within the century. Much of this is due to the fact that English, the socially and economically dominant language, has been forced on Indigenous people. The residential school system, where Indigenous children were removed and isolated from their families and communities, has also played a huge role in the decline of Indigenous languages and cultures. Still today, there is a dire lack of political infrastructure to ensure the maintenance of Indigenous languages, and native speakers are almost always marginalized if they don&#8217;t assimilate. The International Mother Language Day should be taken as a reminder to fight for the preservation of Indigenous languages and cultures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet celebrations of the day in Canada have been scattered, and often have fleeting effects. At McGill, February 21 has the potential to provide an opportunity to raise awareness of the pressures many people are fighting to simply speak their mother language. The threat of many languages disappearing around the world is very real, and February 21 should serve as a reminder to preserve and strengthen the languages and associated cultural identities most threatened by powerful pressures of forced assimilation.</p>

In this tragedy, directed by Harrison Collet and set in Ancient Greece, Antigone (Kay Min) struggles over her uncle King Creon&#8217;s (Alex Bankier) denial of proper burial rites for her traitorous brother Polynices following a civil war. When she decides to defy Creon&#8217;s ruling by sprinkling earth on her brother&#8217;s corpse, each character is faced with a difficult choice.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Antigone</em>, written by Jean Anouilh, was inspired by Greek mythology and by Sophocles&#8217; classical tragedy of the same name. <em>Antigone</em> was first performed in Nazi-occupied France in 1944. The charm of this play lies in its ambiguity. Given the political situation at the time, Anouilh had to tread carefully when representing the rejection of authority, represented by Antigone&#8217;s actions against her uncle&#8217;s law, and the twisted effects power has on Creon himself.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Antigone</em>&#8216;s set is focused on a stool under a spotlight, where all the drama unfolds. On this stool, we see Antigone&#8217;s transition from someone who committed a crime to someone who accepts they must sacrifice themselves for what they believe in. On this same stool we see the struggle of Creon, a man who is not only a king but also an uncle. Creon resorts to begging Antigone to save herself and stop her madness, but his words seem to have no effect on her. Because he must appear as a strong ruler, Creon sentences Antigone to death.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The focus on the stool and the bare-bones set creates a sense of intimacy between the audience and characters. This is especially the case in Antigone&#8217;s soliloquy, when she hunches over and bares her soul. The passion of Antigone&#8217;s entire cast and crew really brings this play to life. Bankier&#8217;s performance as Creon particularly stands out, as he navigates the intricacies of his character&#8217;s internal conflict. Overall, the simplicity of the set and lighting contrasts nicely with the complexity of the play&#8217;s tragedy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When asked about the relevance of Antigone&#8217;s themes today, Collett explained that the tragedy shows the difference between an individual and society, and the difference between what one can do and what one must do. These themes are most obvious in Creon&#8217;s internal struggle regarding the fate of his niece and soon to be daughter-in-law. Collett also went on to mention that the message of the play is even more important today than it might have been when it was first performed, especially in terms of the ideas of state control and surveillance.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Antigone</em>&#8216;s complexity is only fueled by the difficulty of pinpointing who is the villain and who is the hero in the narrative. Is Antigone too stubborn and impulsive, or is Creon too severe? Collett, on his part, said that his sympathies lie with the guards who watch over Polynices&#8217; body, Antigone&#8217;s fiancé Haemon (José Camargo), and Antigone&#8217;s sister Ismene (Vanessa Combe). In his view, they are all innocent bystanders who have to deal with Antigone and Creon&#8217;s actions. Ultimately, it seems like the finger of blame cannot be pointed at any particular character. Rather, the intricacies of political power themselves lie behind Antigone&#8217;s tragedy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Antigone</em> runs from February 19 to 22 at TNC (3485 McTavish). Tickets are $6 for students.</p>

The exhibit, comprised primarily of video projections, is steeped in the artist&#8217;s personal cultural background, and the experience of living through violent conflict in Albania in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Paci makes a bold statement by relying on the use of film as a medium. In fact, Paci himself has said that photography and painting are &#8220;primitive&#8221; artistic modes. This assertion seems appropriate, as the majority of his pieces depict scenes of transition that could not have been captured as aptly in a single photograph or painting.  He manifests this idea by juxtaposing <em>The Visitors</em>, a four part video installation of a wedding procession with <em>Façade</em> and <em>Passages</em> which are located across the gallery. Both of the latter consist of panels of a film strip-esque series of stills, one frame next to the other. Paci intriguingly uses art to critique the media forms themselves, mocking non-video forms and elevating the purpose of his exhibition.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that media inspired by new technologies have given artists diverse tools to capture different moments of life; however, Paci&#8217;s theme of transits lacks direction and clarity. In <em>The Visitors</em>, he attempts to communicate the manner in which an entire Albanian community plays a role in a bride&#8217;s wedding procession, without ever portraying the actual wedding. But the jump from watching the filmed procession of figures in the countryside to recognizing, interpreting, and appreciating the value of the ceremonial tradition is somewhat challenging.  Similarly, <em>Inside the Circle</em>, a black and white video projection of a nude woman pursuing a horse, fails to draw attention or make a connection to the exhibit&#8217;s wider theme of life transitions, experiences, or Albanian culture. This piece would have benefited from deeper explanation and analysis, and without it, the viewer is left wondering what sort of bizarre life metamorphosis it is intended to represent.</p>
<p>Equally puzzling was one of the main pieces designed specifically for this exhibition, <em>The Column</em>. The piece is a video projection showing Chinese workers carving a marble pillar from a block while on a factory boat at sea.  While Paci&#8217;s work clearly exemplifies the concurrent nature of everyday processes, his example of the column, shown in a slow-paced 25-minute film, does not share a deep connection with the themes of the exhibition, and fails to arouse any real emotion. Paci&#8217;s <em>Vajtojca</em> also leaves the viewer confused as to the seriousness of the sentiments of the &#8216;transits.&#8217;  In this piece, the artist is filmed staging his own death rites, only to wake up in the end in a quasi-satirical way as lively music beings to play.</p>
<p>Paci devotes an excessive number of his creations to the motif of marriage as vital life &#8216;transit.&#8217; While this may ring true for some viewers, Paci&#8217;s pieces centering on weddings only reaffirmed the superficiality of the tradition of marriage. In <em>Last Gestures </em>particularly, Paci focuses on the critical moments before a young woman leaves her family forever to enter marriage, slowing down the looped videos to a painfully sluggish rate, seemingly highlighting the critical importance of a life transition that no longer retains the same significance in the modern age as it long did.</p>

This is represented in <em>Per Speculum</em> by the shards of mirror the children carry into a sort of &#8216;tree of life,&#8217; symbolizing rejuvenating of the life of the nation.  Similarly, <em>Albanian Stories</em> highlights the devastation of the war for the younger generation on a deeply personal note, with Paci filming his own three-year-old daughter telling folk stories in which she incorporates military vocabulary like &#8220;soldiers&#8221; and &#8220;international forces.&#8221; This piece is bound to resonate with most viewers, especially as the vintage box-like TV that plays the clip recalls memories of our own childhood in the 1990s. In this regard, Paci lives up to the title of his exhibition, demonstrating how critical societal events affect the transitional period of youth.</p>
<p>Overall, Paci&#8217;s focus on the superiority of certain art media contributes to an atypical exhibition that is refreshing in some senses. Ironically, in line with Paci&#8217;s claim of the inadequacy of still-life representations, the photos of &#8220;Lives in Transit&#8221; in the museum&#8217;s promotional material fail to do justice to the film-based exhibition, giving the show a banal appearance. Furthermore, in asking us to appreciate the life transitions he finds most important, Paci leaves viewers discombobulated by his diverse examples which together fail to deliver a coherent narrative. In fact, it comes across as inappropriate that emotion-evoking examples of a younger generation&#8217;s trauma in a war-torn nation are compared to a staged death ceremony and the hollowed-out significance of the common marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lives in Transit&#8221; will be on display at the Musée d&#8217;art contemporain de Montréal (185 Ste. Catherine W.) until April 27.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Imagine a miniaturized version of yourself clinging to the head of a bullet as you travel through space, while hopelessly struggling to observe the world around you. At any given moment, our visual systems are being flooded with information from the world around us. Amid this stampede of stimuli, our brains have evolved to attend to significant incoming data and ignore irrelevant distractions. For instance, one is more likely to pay attention to a sexual partner than a cardboard box, because one poses a far greater evolutionary advantage than the other. Because we never see the world exactly as it is, our memories will also reflect these biases, revealing that our perceptions and recollections of reality are distorted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These inherent limitations of our species have given rise to lifelogging technologies, first-person video recorders mounted on the user&#8217;s body that  intend to capture the entirety of a person&#8217;s life. The LifeLogger camera records high-definition video and is coupled to a cloud-based online database, which serves to process and organize the mountains of data. The device, positioned to the side of one&#8217;s face, has a GPS, is motion-sensitive, and is able to live-stream events from your perspective to anyone in the world. Further, the GPS permits one to know exactly where they were and in which direction they were facing during these recordings. It is even possible to search for a sound recording and extract other moments when this sound was heard. The device is not only capable of face-detection, but stores every instance of every face ever observed, and permits one to search and replay their moments with this particular person.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is not difficult to imagine the implications of this technology on social media. If individuals begin to share their video-logged data, rather than scrolling through photos of a friend on Facebook, we will be able to search through every instance of their life; perhaps searching for our own face in their LifeLog, and experiencing ourselves from their perspective. Another lifelogging device known as Memento is marketed as a “searchable and shareable photographic memory.&#8221; It may become normative to upload one&#8217;s entire life for public viewing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to visual and auditory stimuli, it is possible that future lifelogging will include information about smell, touch, and spatial location, allowing one to fully experience another person&#8217;s life. Although this may appear unrealistic, consider the oPhone, a device that records and shares smells, which was developed by Le Laboratoire in Paris in collaboration with students at Harvard University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite undeniable privacy concerns, the benefits of such a technological social revolution are limitless. These technologies may be implemented to overcome the inherent limitations of subjective reporting and anecdotal evidence. The benefits to psychologists, epidemiologists, historians, and other scholars would be stupendous. Lifelogging devices may also be used to assist those with untreatable neurological conditions. For instance, researcher Lorena Arcega and her colleagues at San Jorge University, published an article in the open-access journal Sensors to advocate the use of Lifelogging to combat the fallibility and deterioration of memories, particularly with regard to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Further, those with prosopagnosia, a neurological condition that renders the patient unable to recognize faces, would be greatly assisted by the face-detection enabled by LifeLoggers. More generally, those with visual agnosia, a neurological condition where a person  can see but not recognize objects, would be assisted by pattern-detection algorithms that identify objects in one&#8217;s environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though the possibilities are fascinating, there are potential hazards to remembering everything. One person who is naturally endowed with this ability, Jill Price, describes her inability to forget as a curse. Her affliction is known as hyperthymestic syndrome, and the overwhelming information she stores affects her ability to relax and compromises her capacity to sleep. Nonetheless, it is unfair to equate innate photographic memory with an external LifeLogger. Whereas Price felt internally overwhelmed, one who lifelogs is not obliged to rewatch difficult experiences in their lives and is free to delete these recordings.</p>
<p>Lifelogging will revolutionize the way in which we perceive the world, our own lives, and the lives of others. In addition to quantifying our bodies by sequencing our genomes, our species is likely to continue the quantification of our subjective lives. Though subjectivity is an inherent property of an individual, lifelogging may assist in erasing the barriers that separate our subjective selves.</p>

These players are hoping to gain support and membership from athletes across the country in football and basketball (though expansion is possible). They hope to gain some concessions from the colleges that they are establishing as their employers, with the biggest request being health insurance for injuries, extending beyond graduation. Though the union is not yet official, this is a huge first step in getting college athletes represented within a system that has for years exploited them.</p>
<p>Yes, I say exploit, because despite what the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) would like the world to believe, college athletes are unpaid employees. The NCAA contends that they are only &#8216;student-athletes,&#8217; who are compensated by scholarships and room and board. Yet these benefits monetarily pale in comparison to the hundreds of millions of dollars that many big athletic programs and the NCAA itself gain from these players through tickets, TV deals, and merchandise. It is in merchandise sales that we see the collegiate system at its most nefarious.</p>
<p>Jay Bilas, an analyst for the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN), skewered the NCAA&#8217;s hypocrisy this summer by posting pictures on his Twitter account that showed the results of certain searches on the NCAA&#8217;s online shop. Although the site doesn&#8217;t specifically sell the jerseys of individual players (just generic jerseys for each team, with no player names on them), Bilas searched individual player&#8217;s names and, amazingly, the results always pointed to that player&#8217;s &#8216;generic&#8217; jersey. For instance, searching for Johnny Manziel, the former quarterback for Texas A&amp;M University, would bring you to all the Texas A&amp;M number 2 jerseys. (Since Bilas&#8217; tweets, the NCAA has stopped selling these &#8216;generic&#8217; jerseys.) So while the NCAA doesn&#8217;t expressly sell Manziel&#8217;s uniform, they&#8217;ll get the money when you buy that number 2 jersey. Exactly 0 per cent of that sale goes to Manziel. In addition, the NCAA bars players from profiting off of their own fame; Manziel was punished last summer for accepting money in return for autographs. This is twisted logic: the NCAA will unofficially profit off of an athlete, but god forbid an athlete earns money off of their own individual talent.</p>
<p>And, if you&#8217;re an athlete who doesn&#8217;t become a professional – as is the case for the vast majority of student-athletes – you would never see a cent from your playing days. While some can use their college experience as a springboard to future earnings, there&#8217;s a huge class of players who will go into some other profession. These athletes&#8217; packed, nearly year-round schedule, prevents them from having a normal student life or the ability to get a job during school. This leads to many players graduating with a different kind of education than that of a non-athletic student.</p>
<p>Perhaps more troubling is that those who have to stop playing due to injury are often not financially supported for medical costs, and scholarships can often be revoked for minor cause, forcing someone to have to pay their way through the rest of school or leave. All in all, you have a situation where universities draw tons of money from a group with almost no power.</p>
<p>The proposed union would allow these athletes to have a voice in how they&#8217;re treated. As it stands, the NCAA can basically do whatever it wants, and challenging its various rules and decisions is very difficult. Just recently, Oklahoma State University basketball star Marcus Smart was suspended for three games when he shoved a fan after a verbal altercation. Smart has no way to challenge the ruling himself; he either complies with the suspension or tries to get the school to appeal on his behalf. While it&#8217;s likely small potatoes for Smart, who will still in all likelihood be drafted to the pros, for other players these arbitrary decisions can have far-reaching effects, and at the moment they have no means of personally challenging the system outside of university appeals.</p>
<p>When the plans for the union were announced, many were quick to assume that the union would eventually push for compensation for athletes, although the Northwestern players contend that it is not one of their current goals. Still, it seems that if the union is initially successful, they may eventually push for this.</p>
<p>The debate on whether college athletes should be paid has been hotly contested for the past decade or so, almost to a tired ad infinitum. Proponents see the players as exploited and deserving of some small measure for what they produce for the universities; detractors believe that compensation would be financially unfeasible and would ruin the spirit of ëamateurismí within college sports. Intangible arguments aside, the economic arguments against athlete compensation have been debunked; pretty much every university has enough money to compensate their players (one needs only to look at the exorbitant salaries given to athletic directors and coaches, who are often the highest-paid public employees in their state), and richer schools would not gain more of an advantage than they already have in terms of recruiting players.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this union succeeds in the short or long run, there is clearly a problem within the American college sports system. Not paying athletes is a nice idea, born out of an era when sports wasn&#8217;t the gigantic money machine that it is now. The spirit of &#8216;amateurism&#8217; made sense when an education was the main point of an athletic scholarship, when playing a sport was not the primary reason for attending a school, and when the games weren&#8217;t million dollar enterprises. But today, it&#8217;s a mask for exploitation, a way for universities to continually bring in another group of profit machines ready to be disposed of without a second thought.</p>

He never thought that he would be affected by anxiety; he was in many ways a typical, easy-going undergraduate student. “I had a great time at Frosh, I was making lots of new friends, and was generally taking it slow for the first part of the semester.”</p>
<p>Then, around his first midterms, panic set in.</p>
<p>“At first, I thought it was just normal stress. Everyone goes through crunch time in October. Then, it started to get worse; I skipped classes because I felt unprepared and stressed out. At a certain point, I just couldn’t leave my room anymore.”</p>
<p>Dylan’s story is one of many at McGill. Mental Health Services saw an estimated 20,000 visits in the 2010-11 school year, double the figure seen five years prior.</p>
<p>Nina*, an Arts student who met with a counsellor in her second semester, also found the transition to McGill very trying.</p>
<p>“McGill was scary […] I did really poorly in my first semester, and felt pretty lost,” she said. In addition, she was coping with family mental health issues and the stress of working part-time. By the time her second semester began, Nina was suffering from depression.</p>
<p>A recurring theme in conversations about mental health at McGill is the role of academic stress in triggering or exacerbating mental health issues. Students who spoke with The Daily pointed to grade deflation and adjustment to life in a new city as triggering mental health issues.</p>
<p>This issue is gaining a great deal of attention nationwide. According to The Globe and Mail, after having experienced a rash of student deaths in the last few years, Queen’s University established a committee in 2012 to reduce the impact of mental health issues at the university. The committee produced a report outlining 116 recommendations for change, ranging from proactive intervention, to the rescheduling of exams, to the extension of the semester.</p>
<p>According to Katrina Bartellas, co-founder of the McGill chapter of Unleash the Noise, a peer support group run as a supplement to campus mental health services, student mental health issues often go unaddressed until they reach a breaking point.</p>
<p>“We are not helping ourselves by neglecting our mental health until it reaches a critical point,” she told The Daily by email. “Instead, we need to be mindful of our mental health on a continual basis, especially as students.”</p>
<p>Nina, for example, only sought help at the suggestion of a professor at the end of her first year. By this point, she had already reached a low point and was considering dropping out.</p>
<p>Like many others, Nina encountered difficulties in relating her experience to her peers. “McGill creates a very competitive atmosphere that’s conducive to harsh judgment between peers […] some people have serious difficulties that require specific support.”</p>
<p>Bartellas spoke to the stigmatization of mental health issues by pointing to the “Bridge the Gap” speaker series run by Unleash the Noise.</p>
<p>“The mandate of the speaker series is to bridge the gap in understanding between McGill students, faculty, and staff with either direct or indirect lived experience[s] with mental illness and those without,” she said. “Simply put, individuals at McGill with mental illness, or with a friend or family member with mental illness, share their personal story with others to decrease stigmatized attitudes on campus.”</p>
<p>The Queen’s University report ultimately recommended greater administrative and academic flexibility, comprehensive stress-management strategies, and longer semesters with less dense coursework to help prevent many students from experiencing severe anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>This year at McGill has seen various initiatives at McGill to address mental health. The Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU)has formed an ad-hoc mental health committee, and the University’s joint Senate-Board of Governors meeting this year featured a theme on mental health. Additionally, according to information provided by McGill’s Director of Internal Communications Doug Sweet, wait lists at Mental Health Services have gone down this term from 270 to 56 people.</p>
<p>According to Bartellas, a new mental health policy created under the SSMU ad-hoc committee will soon be presented to Council.</p>
<p>As for Dylan, his outcome was fortunate; not wanting to wait for help from McGill, he decided to see a private therapist. “It’s expensive, yeah, but I was facing academic probation and I knew that I couldn’t go on suffering.” With cognitive behavioural therapy and stress management planning, in addition to informing and working with professors, he learned to manage his anxiety and organize his thoughts positively.</p>
<p>“I know there [are] lots of people who are nervous to get psychological help; I was one of them. Just go for it, and don’t worry about others; your health matters first.”</p>

My mum signed me up to get the shot,” he said. Now a U3 History student at McGill, Chris doesn’t think about his inoculation much. “I really don’t know how many of my friends have it. I wouldn’t be surprised if some of my other guy friends had it, but I would be shocked if it was as prevalent as amongst my female friends. I think it’s somewhat stigmatized because it’s considered a disease that only affects females. That isn’t true, but I feel like that is the perception. Guys don’t want to get a shot for what they think of as a disease only women get.”</p>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is primarily conceptualized as a women’s ailment, with the majority believing that it is affiliated with cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers alone; however, it is also linked to penile, anal, and head and neck cancers, associating it with around 5 per cent of cancers worldwide. The vaccinations Gardasil and Cervarix can protect individuals if they are vaccinated prior to being exposed to the virus. Both vaccines protect against different strains of the virus, and while Gardasil has been approved for both females and males between the ages of 9 and 26, Cervarix is only available for females between 10 and 25. </p>
<p>In 2007, the first girls received HPV vaccines in Canada. By September 2008, all provinces in Canada had school-based vaccine programs targeting girls as young as nine. This is a cost measure, as at age nine a child will only need two injections, instead of three, to be immune. Depending on the province, girls have the option to begin the shots in Grade four or five, and have another opportunity in Grade nine, or seek the inoculation for free at a clinic or from their practitioner.</p>
<p>In April 2013, Prince Edward Island became the first province in Canada to include boys in their HPV vaccination campaigns. In September 2014, Alberta will follow suit. According to <a href="http://www.health.alberta.ca/health-info/imm-HPV.html ">Alberta Health’s website</a>, the government decided to extend coverage of the HPV vaccination to boys because it can “save lives, reduce disease and reduce future health care costs.” They estimate that the cost savings for the system from this policy change could amount to over $13.4 million.</p>
<blockquote><p>If men can carry the disease and women can contract it from a male sexual partner, then not vaccinating men seems like it is ignoring a huge factor in the spread of HPV.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quebec has chosen to not fund vaccination programs for boys, based on the assumption that inoculating females will indirectly protect males, and that if males want it, they will seek it on their own. Even though this inoculation policy does regard women as sexual beings, it assigns them a one-sided HPV burden in the responsibility and prevention paradigm. And while the shot is available for men, its high cost makes it inaccessible to many, with three doses of Gardasil costing $500. Furthermore, males are not educated about the virus to the same extent as females, and many men don’t even know that they are vulnerable, believing HPV to be responsible only for cervical cancer. NovaRogue**, a Political Science, Sociology, and Sexual Diversity McGill alumnus to whom I spoke via a thread on the McGill forum on Reddit, only found out that the vaccine was an option for him when he was advised by a nurse at age 21. He feels that men are “not at all” informed or advised to learn more about the vaccine in the same way women are. </p>
<p>In Chris’ understanding of vaccines, “maximum inoculation is when they are most effective. If men can carry the disease and women can contract it from a male sexual partner, then not vaccinating men seems like it is ignoring a huge factor in the spread of HPV.” According to Eduardo Franco, professor in the departments of Epidemiology and Biostatics, director of the division of Cancer Epidemiology, and chair of the Oncology department at McGill’s Faculty of Medicine, the Quebec government decided not to cover male vaccination because of the cost. “In Quebec they did a lot of evaluating; [the Quebec government] evaluated the cost and decided it was too much. They’ve done a good job covering women, and so did not adopt a publicly-available vaccine for boys. By covering women they are also indirectly covering men,” noted Franco. </p>
<p>This assumption also leaves the category of men who have sex with men at risk and wholly responsible for ensuring their safety in a way that women and men having sex with women are not. This subset of the population is in fact getting no publicly-funded protection. If men can be vectors of transmission, it seems ineffective not to vaccinate everyone. NovaRogue thinks that the current policy is discriminatory toward men who have sex with men (MSM), and calls the decision “short-sighted,” and “very possibly another example of institutionalized/systemic homophobia/heteronormativity.” Kristina Dahlstrom, postdoctoral fellow in the division of Cancer Epidemiology of the Oncology department, agrees, “By vaccinating only girls we are effectively not protecting MSM against HPV. MSM have a high prevalence of HPV and are at an increased risk of developing anal cancer.” </p>
<p>Franco says that as vaccines go down in cost, it is likely that more inclusive public coverage will happen. He hopes that his current study at McGill, the TRAP-HPV study, will shed light on opportunities for this. The TRAP-HPV study differs from other studies because it looks at non-genital sites, like oral and anal regions, and aims to determine whether unvaccinated partners of vaccinated individuals benefit in terms of protection from their partner’s HPV vaccination. Dahlstrom told the<em> <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/does-vaccinating-one-sexual-partner-benefit-other-232707">McGill Newsroom</a></em>, “Increasing the knowledge about HPV transmission dynamics will benefit cost-effectiveness studies and have implications for decision-making when implementing population-level vaccination strategies.”</p>
<p>Andrew Doyle, an English Masters student at McGill, believes that, “In an ideal world, we would vaccinate everyone against everything, but in reality it costs too much. Me or my girlfriend might have it even though we’ve never had symptoms. [sic] I don’t really think about it differently than other STIs, but if there’s a vaccine for it, why not?”</p>
