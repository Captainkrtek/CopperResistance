<p>Police are looking for a 78-year-old man who disappeared from the UBC Purdy Pavilion yesterday.</p>
<p>According to police, Edward Grant was last seen at the Purdy Pavilion around 9 a.m. on Jan. 21.</p>
<p>Police said Grant left the pavilion, which is a part of the UBC Hospital, with a black suitcase. He is described as a black male of Caribbean descent, 5-foot-9 and 150 pounds. He is bald with brown eyes and dark-framed glasses. He was wearing all black and a fedora hat, dress shirt and coat when he was last seen.</p>
<p>According to police, Grant has dementia and can be aggressive if confronted. He is also diabetic but not dependent on insulin.</p>
<p>RCMP have asked anyone with information on Grant&#8217;s whereabouts to contact them at 604-224-1322 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.</p>

<p>An open house on Monday showcased the new Orchard Commons, one of many new mixed-use hubs set to open around UBC. </p>
<p>The site will cost an estimated $125.9 million, with construction expected to start this summer and finish by the summer of 2016. The Commons will be the home of the new <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/vantage-college-367/">Vantage College</a> program.</p>
<p>Vantage College will be a program for international first-year students who meet the academic requirements for UBC, but not necessarily the language requirements. </p>
<p>Jana Foit, the lead architect of the project, said the goal of the Commons is to get students immersed in UBC.</p>
<p>“It’s really to get them immersed in the culture and the community and to make sure they have every opportunity to speak English,&#8221; Foit said.</p>
<p>The Commons will have 1,048 beds dedicated to Vantage College students. Two single rooms will share one bathroom similar to the həm&#8217;ləsəm&#8217; and q&#8217;ələχən houses in Totem Park. However, Foit said that if the college does not meet its set enrolment targets, the residence may open up for other UBC students. All other amenities will be open for other UBC students.</p>
<p>The building itself will feature two residence towers, a dining hall with 350 seats, classrooms, study spaces, offices for staff, a convenience store, child care facilities and end-of-the-line facilities for cyclists. </p>
<p>Alannah Yip, a third-year engineering student, questioned the location of the Commons. “It seems like its its own college and I don&#8217;t see why it is in the middle of campus,” said Yip. </p>
<p>The Orchard Commons will be located on the northeast corner of West Mall and Agronomy Road. The site is currently occupied by the Orchard Garden, a community garden and outdoor classroom run by students in the Faculties of Land and Food Systems and Education. The garden will be moved to the Totem Park field. </p>
<p>Julia Ostertag, an Acadia Park resident involved with the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/opinion/katic-proposed-destruction-of-community-garden-emblematic-of-higher-ed-funding-problems/">Orchard Garden</a>, has been working with Campus and Community Planning to establish a new home for the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been difficult trying to find a permanent site. A lot of back and forth. There was a lot of uncertainty,&#8221; said Ostertag.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lose that proximity to campus [in the new Totem Park field location],&#8221; said Ostertag. “It was always the goal to have a site that is permanent, so we’re happy with that. However, it has been sad.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>The Ubyssey</em> has long had a special fondness for our university’s dear leader, Stephen J. Toope. A distinguished human rights lawyer and now renowned administrator, Toope has brought a progressive perspective to an often staid position: president of a very old university.</p>
<p>Now, though, we are saddened to learn that our very own Toope has <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/toope-u-of-t-235/" target="_blank">chosen the University of Toronto</a> as his new home. We are forced to ask whether that J stands not for John, but for Judas. When we found out last spring that Toope would be stepping down this year — best to leave while he still enjoyed it, he explained — we understood. But upon discovering that our precious Stephen views U of T — that dastardly eastern rival which represents the antithesis of all that is good in this word — as superior to our own institution, our hearts have broken to extent difficult to reconcile with our previous love.</p>
<p>We knew Toope — who, in his humble charm, prefers to be addressed as Professor Toope rather than Dr. Toope — wanted to return to academia, and he is doing so as director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at U of T. But need we remind the professor that UBC itself has plenty of options for a return to academia? For a man who spent his term as president trying to improve UBC’s academic standing in the world, to leave us for a competitor is nothing less than betrayal.</p>
<p>We put our faith — nay, our full trust, to say nothing of love, into this man, only for him to turn our backs on us for supposedly greener, if snowier, pastures out east. Suffice it to say that our too-short love affair (aren’t they always) with Steve has ended.</p>
<p>It is still to early to properly digest our feelings on the matter. Indeed, perhaps Norman Rush put it best when he wrote, “I feel like someone after a deluge being asked to describe the way it was before the flood while I’m still plucking seaweed out of my hair.”</p>
<p>Life with the knowledge that Toope will soon be academiating in Toronto while we slave away in the Vancouver rain is not something we can yet fully describe. But nor can we explain exactly what it is we are losing.</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Koerner&#8217;s ain&#8217;t all that, kids</h3>
<p>Though we appreciate our food writer&#8217;s enthusiasm for <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/culture/koerners-pub-healthier-menu521/" target="_blank">Koerner&#8217;s Pub</a> and its reworked menu, we would — pardon the pun — like to add just a touch of salt to her verdict.</p>
<p>Before it shut down for renovations a few years ago, the atmosphere in Koerner&#8217;s was convivial; though a bit crowded, the decor, the lighting and the space itself conveyed a traditional student pub sentimentality. It felt, you might say, &#8220;lived-in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not so after last year&#8217;s re-opening. The proprietors of Koerner&#8217;s have marketed their establishment towards a more stylized, postmodern student mindset. The problem is that it plays to this mindset right down to a tee.</p>
<p>The warm ambiance of the old bar has been replaced with a more sterile aesthetic. The drink menu, provided on clipboards, is filled with clever self-awareness: PBR is described as a &#8220;cheap and shitty lager,&#8221; Jager Bombs are deemed &#8220;bad decisions,&#8221; and water — which is served in a Mason jar rather than a glass — is referred to as &#8220;dihydrogen monoxide.&#8221; Rather than pitchers, one pours their beer out of a growler bottle, which must be hoisted over the shoulder and poured, Athenian-style, into a cup. And the televisions, for whatever reason, play Bill Murray films ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Being owned by the Graduate Student Society, it only makes sense that Koerner&#8217;s would evoke a quasi-cynical attitude in its menu and decor; they can hardly be faulted for appealing to their target demographic. We only wish the pub wouldn&#8217;t beat us over the head with the fact that we are poor, miserable students who, paradoxically, also need to spend a fortune on organic food and artisanal alcohols in order to justify our education.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Debates kind of a snorefest</h3>
<p>So far, this year&#8217;s AMS elections debates have left a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>On Monday, both <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/vp-external-missing-325/" target="_blank">VP external</a> candidates missed their debating slots, which didn&#8217;t make for much interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/2014-presidential-debate-235/" target="_blank">presidential</a> and <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/bog-debate-235/" target="_blank">BoG candidates</a> had more lively debates, the moderator allowed for few questions, shutting out many audience members — including our reporters.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s debates had a different moderator, but less than impressive questions. At one point, the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/clubs-subs-admin-debate-354/" target="_blank">VP admin</a> candidates were asked about the VP admin and university affairs portfolio, which doesn&#8217;t exist. The moderator later asked the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/student-senate-debate235/" target="_blank">Senate candidates</a> which other candidates in their race they would vote for, only to be cut off by the elections administrator before he had to issue slating violations.</p>
<p>We hope the final AMS debate on Monday will be better organized and give more audience members a chance to participate.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">What makes a team varsity?</h3>
<p>The results of the first phase of the UBC sports review were <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/sports-review-314/" target="_blank">announced yesterday</a>, with 16 teams being guaranteed varsity status. The number was surprisingly high, which suggests that perhaps more teams than originally thought reach the designed varsity criteria, but there were some curious omissions on the first list.</p>
<p>The teams who are safe don&#8217;t really come as a surprise. Basketball, football and women&#8217;s volleyball were locks from the start, and while some may raise an eyebrow at rowing, cross-country and track and field, those teams regularly produce national team members and achieve consistent success at the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/naia-xc013/" target="_blank">university level</a>. But women&#8217;s soccer, men&#8217;s hockey and men&#8217;s volleyball not being on the list has led to some furrowed brows and even some outrage.</p>
<p>The main takeaway appears to be that the varsity teams are the most well-rounded ones. While many of the teams left off the list have had recent success — <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/mens-vball-sweeps-bobcats115/" target="_blank">men&#8217;s volleyball</a>, women&#8217;s soccer, <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-baseball-season-preview-213/" target="_blank">baseball</a>, men&#8217;s field hockey men&#8217;s, <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-alpine-skiing201/" target="_blank">skiing</a>, softball and <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/womens-golf-national-champs-829/" target="_blank">women&#8217;s golf</a> — they clearly lack in areas such as &#8220;fit with university tradition&#8221; and &#8220;community support and tradition&#8221; (although that still doesn&#8217;t explain women&#8217;s soccer, which is one of Canada&#8217;s fastest growing sports and has a Canadian soccer legend for a coach). </p>
<p>And while men&#8217;s hockey and women&#8217;s rugby might have support and tradition, they lack recent success; men&#8217;s hockey has only two playoff series wins in more than 40 years, and women&#8217;s rugby is 5-15 over the past five years.</p>
<p>A few more teams are expected to be added, so some teams still have hope. But since these teams now have a better idea of how to meet the criteria, perhaps the second phase will also produce more varsity teams than originally thought.</p>

<p>The AMS has suspended Hempology 101&#8242;s SUB booking privileges in response to a <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/ubc-hempology-club-sub-494/">vaporizer session</a> they hosted on Jan. 10.</p>
<p>The Student Administrative Commission (SAC) issued the punishment after talking to the club at a meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Running a club, especially a newer club, can be a slightly daunting process, and everyone makes mistakes,&#8221; said SAC vice-chair Nina Scott. &#8220;This was an unfortunate one. We&#8217;re happy to work more closely with them &#8230; and help them make sure something like this doesn&#8217;t happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The club&#8217;s booking privileges have been suspended until the end of April.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re kicked out of the SUB entirely, just that we essentially are denied privacy for a semester,&#8221; said Hempology 101 treasurer Corbin Manson.</p>
<p>The club will still be able to host events outside the SUB.</p>
<p>&#8220;What they do off campus on their own time with their own financial means in their own group is completely up to them. We have absolutely no interest in silencing them or taking any extreme punitive action,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>Manson said that although the club&#8217;s booking privileges are suspended, the AMS will still let them host the hemp convention they have planned for March.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to negotiate a room for out cannabis convention in March, which is the most important event of the year, so I&#8217;m really happy that they still are going to be giving us space for the big convention,&#8221; said Manson.</p>
<p>Scott said SAC plans to work with Hempology 101 to help them boost their image on campus, and that neither campus security nor the RCMP are seeking any legal action against them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We absolutely don&#8217;t want to take away their right to free speech. Whatever they want to say is fine by us, and we want to help make sure they get their message across and they&#8217;re portrayed in the light they want to be,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>Manson said SAC encouraged his club to set up tables in the SUB to help spread their message about cannabis education.</p>
<p>&#8220;A table is a great way to do education and outreach because it&#8217;s so visible,&#8221; Manson said. &#8220;We want to do things centred around hemp and cannabis education and also just wellness in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a meeting coming up on Friday and we&#8217;ll be able to hash out more concrete plans as to how we want to approach tabling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manson said the club is working to organize their March conference and to improve their image after the vaporizer session.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be lying low for a little bit now that all of this has played out. We&#8217;re going to be looking at how we can move forward. As a club, we still have some repurposing, maybe, that we need to be doing before we can have anything concrete happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello, fellow human being:  </p>
<p>Your reporting of Hempology 101&#8242;s civil disobedience is unfortunate. It smacks of misinformation and oppression. You know that whatever hurts others hurts you. So it is when the most progressive institutes do not support peaceful civil disobedience against unjust laws. </p>
<p>Those who oppose tyranny must creatively change bad laws by drawing attention to their cruelty and absurdity. If we are to have a society which reflects the will of the people on cannabis, we must challenge the present marijuana laws. We wouldn&#8217;t be alone doing so.</p>
<p>Why, even the United Nations delegates are walking away from enforcing the militancy of the War on Drugs, because they see a need to stop hurtful action and to restore peace. At UBC, these vaporizing people are providing awareness you can&#8217;t teach in a classroom. By harassing them, you slow the pace of change. Next time you think about the coffee vapour coming off the rim of your cup, think of the vapour that for a moment spread freedom through the halls of the SUB. Be glad that a few brave students are forging compassionate social change with a healthful herb and prompting political awareness at the university.  </p>
<p>Let them, for a few seconds, while contained in a small spot, vaporize without fear of the police or suffering personal or career loss. I salute the courage of those who oppose oppression. We are all either for the Redcoats or for freedom. Make no mistake: this is a war on people, and Harper has prisons hungry for young occupants. You decide if you want to pass this war on to your friends and children. All should stand up for the activities of Hempology 101 as they march toward the dissolution of enforcement myths and the immorality of a bad law. Smart people should spotlight the corruption which serves the War on Drugs by showing support for the activities of Hempology 101.  </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Carol Francey,<br />

<p>What’s in a label?</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years ago today, Little Richard, James Brown and Elvis Presley were among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The &#8220;rock and roll&#8221; classification was by no means rigid — after all, James Brown was “the Godfather of Soul.”</p>
<p>So do we really value the labels? Are the Grammy Awards’ genre-blurring collaborations just an audience-grabbing stunt for live television, or can they influence the music business as a whole? </p>
<p>In a revealing <a href="http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/kanye-west#_">conversation</a> with <em>Interview Magazine</em>, Kanye West told <em>12 Years a Slave</em> director Steve McQueen about being put in a box as a rap artist, and how he finds it “marginalizing.” </p>
<p>As polarizing as West is, his influence in the music industry is undeniable. Despite an insatiable desire for wider recognition and leaving the awards with a gramophone in seven of nine years from 2004 to 2012, West has never won an award outside the rap and R&#038;B categories.</p>
<p>Still, genre-crossing collaborations are often the highlight of the award show each year, even serving as political platforms. Past alliances included Radiohead with the University of Southern California marching band, and Lady Gaga and Elton John’s seamless mashup of “Speechless” and “Your Song.” But perhaps the most unexpected odd couple was Eminem and Elton John, who <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439280/eminem-elton-john-duet-at-grammys.jhtml">came together</a> in 2001 to make a public statement after Eminem’s homophobic lyrics outraged many listeners. </p>
<p>This year, Kendrick Lamar will perform with fellow nominees Imagine Dragons, and Stevie Wonder will join Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers on stage.</p>
<p>When rap music was finally included at the 31st annual awards, the category was not televised. Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GgtTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4IEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3889,5146564&amp;dq">boycotted the awards</a>, Smith saying that “the real Grammy award is the chance to appear on the Grammy Awards show with its audience of 100 million Americans.&#8221; Of the 82 award categories this year, only about 10 will make the live broadcast. </p>
<p>On a recent <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> appearance, LL Cool J, the 2014 Grammys host, said he never followed the music charts. Then he described how the acceptance of rap has impacted mainstream measures of success. </p>
<p>“Now you’ll hear about rappers who have 10 Grammys and 90 Grammys,” he told Kimmel. “If they were giving out Grammys when I started, I might have that many as well. But I have two. And nine nominations.”</p>
<p>Not like he’s keeping track or anything.</p>
<p>This year’s Best Record of the Year nominees include Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines”, the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/retail/5855152/justin-timberlakes-2020-2013s-best-selling-album-blurred-lines-top">top-selling song</a> of 2013 in the United States. The Song of the Year <a href="http://www.grammy.com/nominees">nominees list</a> reads like a Top 40 list of overplayed radio tracks.</p>
<p>This year, it seems as though mass download choices, rather than genre, have affected who ends up with the coveted hardware at the end of the night. Maybe next year West will have broken out of his box.  </p>

<p>Last semester, several UBC students from the Social Justice Centre, organized under the banner of <a href="www.notfrommycampus.wordpress.com">Not From My Campus</a>, started raising questions about UBC’s new federal government-funded international mining institute.</p>
<p>The institute — the Canadian International Institute for Extractive Industries and Development — is supposed to help developing countries grow economically by offering expertise on regulations and technical assistance on resource extraction.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is providing the $24 million for the Institute. CIDA has been recently folded into the Department of Foreign Affairs, so as to align Canadian international development with trade policy. One of the institute’s functions will be to, through an advisory centre, give developing countries’ governments advice on their domestic extractive industry policies.</p>
<p>Other students and I met with UBC President Stephen Toope and members of the executive board of the institute last semester to share their concerns about what we saw as a clear conflict of interest: UBC hosting an institute, which will give advice to developing countries on their resource policies, funded by a government that wants to promote Canadian extractive companies abroad. The board responded that the institute will not work for Canadian companies, but for national governments on their request. Nevertheless, many countries where Canada and our companies have interest in, such as Colombia, have brutally displaced people to open land for foreign mining corporations.</p>
<p>Recently, students received a message from Toope assuring us that the institute will be independent from Ottawa and will work towards poverty reduction. However, Toope also shared the agreement between CIDA and UBC which states that the institute must get approval from CIDA for talking to the media, that Canadian investment will be a significant factor in what regions the institute decides to work in, and that the institute is accountable to the Canadian government.</p>
<p>Toope&#8217;s message also argues that the institute won’t promote any particular government foreign policy. However, it seems this institute is completely consistent with what Ottawa wants.</p>

<p>Over time, I have come to realize that wherever you are in the world, there are some pubs that are in a class of their own — pubs that have a certain je ne sais quoi. There is more to a pub than just a pint of Guinness and comfort food; they&#8217;re a place to unwind with those closest to us. They&#8217;re places with a welcoming ambiance, compelling us to return simply &#8220;because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry,&#8221; as Ecclesiastes puts it.</p>
<p>I am comfortably seated on a stool, gazing at the newly refurbished Koerner’s Pub. A few years ago, when I celebrated my first-year freedom with a friend and an apple cider, Koerner’s was an outdated haunt in need of a revamp. Fast-forward four years, and the pub has made a style statement of its own. Streamlined, light and airy with cool concrete floors and lengthy wooden benches, it’s hip, but still cosy.</p>
<p>After having been closed since May 2011, Koerner’s Pub officially re-opened its doors to the UBC community on Oct. 15 of last year. Tim Yu, Koerner’s Pub principal, explained the pub&#8217;s new objectives for the coming months.</p>

<p>“We just wanted to open a pub that really felt like a place for students,&#8221; Yu said. &#8220;We wanted to put together a food menu that we’re proud of, so a lot of our food is sustainable. And then we’re trying to do more cultural things like &#8230; live music [on Tuesday nights], and we’ve got some plans for pub quizzes later on in the term.”</p>
<p>While there are no major changes to the menu just yet, students can expect to find classic pub plates on offer such as fish and chips, or Koerner’s organic burger, a popular item so far. But there are also healthier alternatives to chose from, suitable for vegans and vegetarians, that promise to taste good and fill you up. </p>
<p>“One thing we’re most excited about is our juice program,&#8221; Yu said. &#8220;We do fresh juices daily now. Some of the things we do here are perhaps a little less healthy, so we thought we’d counteract that a bit and bring some of the healthy lifestyle in that’s important to students and also to us.&#8221;</p>
<div class="ub_box ub_box_img"><a href="http://ubyssey.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koerners_20130816__Mab-Coates-Davies-2.jpg"><img src="http://ubyssey.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koerners_20130816__Mab-Coates-Davies-2-300x200.jpg" alt="Koerners" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-42535" /></a></div>
<p>Koerner’s Pub makes use of both worlds: comfort foods, but with a healthy twist. Serving only meats and poultry that are hormone free and naturally raised, and free-range eggs and OceanWise seafood, it’s a pub that is sustainable as it is modern.</p>
<p>The staff&#8217;s student ethos and passion for feel-good-food have made it a success among the student community so far, and it’s not difficult to see why. </p>
<p>“Koerner’s has a bit more of a personal touch, because we’re here every day and we really care, and because we’re former students, that shows in the stuff that we do and we understand the student community,” said Yu.</p>
<p>Sipping on the Brainiac — one of the pub&#8217;s fresh pressed juices of pure vegetable and fruit goodness — I contemplated pubs and their je-ne-sais-quoi quality. Quenching my thirst, I thoroughly enjoyed the delightful blend of red beet, carrot, and apple fused with zingy ginger and cooling cucumber, giving me that needed boost of energy after a long day. And this is when I came to realize that, for me, a pub with that je ne sais quoi is a pub with a personal touch, much like the new Koerner’s — perhaps the most exciting thing to hit UBC in years.</p>

<p>UBC President Stephen Toope has accepted a job as the director of U of T&#8217;s Munk School of Global Affairs.</p>
<p>Toope, who announced his <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/breaking-stephen-toope-to-step-down-in-june-2014/">resignation</a> from the role of UBC president last year, will start his new job in January 2015. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Munk School has built a reputation around the world for its thoughtful and insightful examination of international issues,&#8221; said Toope in a <a href="http://media.utoronto.ca/media-releases/arts/stephem-toope-international-law-scholar-named-director-of-u-of-ts-munk-school-of-global-affairs/">press release</a>. “I look forward to joining its outstanding researchers and students in working to understand and tackle global problems.” </p>
<p>When Toope announced his resignation, he said his future job would involve international law and international relations. Toope&#8217;s resignation takes effect June 30.</p>
<p>“The months ahead will be important on so many crucial issues for UBC,” Toope said in a <a href="http://news.ubc.ca/2014/01/22/stephen-toope-to-lead-u-of-ts-munk-school-of-global-affairs/">press release</a>. “My entire focus will be on UBC until the end of my term.”</p>

<p>When UBC released the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/sports-review-314/" title="Women’s soccer and men’s hockey left dangling in initial sports review results" target="_blank">initial results</a> of its sports targeting review yesterday morning, many varsity athletes were left in shock.</p>
<p>“It was obviously bittersweet and challenging,” said Laura Thompson, a fifth-year swimmer. “It’s kind of out of our control at this point.”</p>
<p>Thompson’s team is safe, and deservedly so — the women’s swim team at UBC has the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/by-the-numbers-the-past-year-in-ubc-athletics393/" title="By the numbers: The past year in UBC athletics" target="_blank">most CIS national championship titles</a> — 18 — of any varsity sports team in Canada. But for the president of the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/t-birds-5-on-5-athlete-council013/" title="T-Birds 5-on-5: Thunderbird Athletes Council" target="_blank">Thunderbird Athletes Council</a> (TAC), there was never going to be an easy way out.  </p>
<p>“I’m kind of struggling personally in that regard, just with how I can lead the TAC through this, because obviously it’s going to have a major impact on how our meetings are every day when certain teams know that they are through and certain teams aren’t through.”</p>
<div class="ub_quote"><span class="double-quote">&#8220;</span><p>It was obviously bittersweet and challenging. It’s kind of out of our control at this point.&#8221;</p><p class="author">&#8212;&nbsp; Laura Thompson, UBC swimmer and TAC president</p></div>
<p>Not only does Thompson have to lead a group of athletes whose community and livelihoods are threatened, she also hopes to help the swim team bring home their third straight <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-swimming-cis-champs293/" title="UBC women’s swimming repeats as CIS champs, men finish second" target="_blank">CIS championship banner</a>. But first things first — the Canada West Championships are happening this weekend in Calgary.</p>
<p>“I had a very strict conversation with my coach,” Thompson said. “I can’t really let what’s going on here affect my performance because at the end of the day it is all about athletics, and winning CanWest is the number one thing for us.”</p>
<p>For hockey player Nate Fleming, whose team is on thin ice, the goal is to keep the program alive. With a 7-12-1 record, the men&#8217;s team has struggled this season, but made a turning point over winter break when they beat North Dakota, an NCAA Division 1 powerhouse with a roster containing 15 NHL draft picks and a $3 million budget.</p>
<p>“We are worried, but we have to just keep our focus on the season and make a push for the playoffs,” Fleming said. “We have a good enough team and we played well against [CIS No.2] Alberta this weekend. If we make the playoffs, we can make a push and anything can happen.”</p>
<p>Fleming also hopes team alumni and some community groups will step up and show their support. There’s already been a noticeable movement on Twitter encouraging UBC fans to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SaveUBCHockey&amp;src=tyah" target="_blank">#SaveUBCHockey</a> and #SellOutTheDoug for the Thunderbirds&#8217; upcoming home games this weekend.</p>
<p>As a fourth-year student-athlete, the changes won’t affect Fleming personally, but they would affect a lot of his teammates. “[I’m] also surprised, not just about us, but the women’s soccer and men’s volleyball,” he said. “Those are pretty major programs, and UBC’s such a big school, so I just assumed major programs like that would be safe.”</p>
<p>Without varsity status, Fleming doesn’t see how men’s hockey could carry on here. “It takes such a big budget to run the program. I just think it would be impossible to do. I’m sure a lot of younger players would have to leave and find another school to play for.”</p>
<p>Although she is graduating soon, Christina Donnelly was similarly concerned about her younger teammates who are scared and wondering if they need to start looking elsewhere. As one of few <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/christina-donnelly-alpine-skier-soccer-player039/" title="Skier/soccer player Christina Donnelly is an athlete for all seasons" target="_blank">two-sport varsity athletes</a> at UBC, Donnelly has a unique perspective on the sports review, and is likely the only Thunderbird in both an individual and team sport that didn’t make the first-stage safe list.</p>
<p>“I was more shocked for soccer than for skiing. I think I’m still just in a bit of a state of shock,” Donnelly said. “I just think the entire thing hasn’t been transparent at all and a lot of people haven’t been well-informed, and that’s been one of the biggest problems of the whole thing.”</p>
<div class="ub_quote"><span class="double-quote">&#8220;</span><p>I think I’m still just in a bit of a state of shock. I just think the entire thing hasn’t been transparent at all and a lot of people haven’t been well-informed, and that’s been one of the biggest problems of the whole thing.&#8221;</p><p class="author">&#8212;&nbsp; Christina Donnelly, women's soccer player and alpine skier</p></div>
<p>While her soccer coaches insisted the team stay positive and realize they haven’t officially lost their varsity status yet, the alpine ski team is less optimistic. “It’s got quite a smaller chance of going through stage two,” Donnelly conceded. “Whether or not we’re going to exist past 2015, I’m not really sure.”</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this, Donnelly said, is that alpine skiing is a student-run and student-coached team, and those students are usually high-level athletes who could have gone somewhere else to ski, but chose to come to UBC. If it loses its status as a varsity sport, UBC may be less likely to attract high-level competitive skiers. </p>
<p>“The varsity status changes the game,” said Donnelly. “It’s not necessarily that there wouldn’t be people around to be on an alpine skiing club, but I don’t think that level of organization or knowledge of the sport to be able to run a team would be around anymore.”</p>
<p>Donnelly, who like Thompson is a part of the TAC executive, feels the review process has been disruptive to the athletic community. “I think in the early stages, everyone was kind of on the same page, kind of against the review,” she said. “Then when people started looking more into it, it really got divided. The teams that had a good chance of going through and felt safe were really for the review, and teams that really felt vulnerable obviously were very against the review.”</p>
<p>Tuesday’s announcement and the ensuing stage two announcement in February may divide the athletic community even more. But Thompson urged everyone to stay positive and remember one simple thing: “We’re all Thunderbirds still. Once a Thunderbird, always a Thunderbird.”</p>
