<p>After a thrilling win Friday night in double overtime, the Thunderbirds men’s hockey team fell to the Calgary Dinos 3-1 on Saturday. </p>
<p>The team played to a much-larger-than-usual crowd both nights, bolstered by the #SaveUBCHockey and #SellOutTheDoug hashtags on social media. From hardened fans with “#GOTBIRDSGO!” spelled out across 12 bellies screaming at ice level to first-time attendees having rules about faceoffs explained to them by their friends, the audience buzzed with UBC pride. </p>
<p>The Thunderbird marching band drummed up chants of “U-B-C! U-B-C!” while neon signs displayed an extremely relevant “Keep Calm and Love Men’s Hockey”, and perhaps a less accurate but still sweet sentiment of “#1 on the ice, #1 in our heart.&#8221;. </p>
<p>UBC head coach Milan Dragicevic loved the energy his team got from the crowd. “This was impressive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I give the people, the media and those who showed up a lot of credit for coming. Even though we lost, the game was entertaining — it came right down to the last minute. That’s what university hockey’s all about, and we want to be a big part of that going forward.”</p>
<p>The team was still pumped up Saturday night from their double OT win, and came out of the gate hard. They thought they had the first marker 3:45 into the game, but Calgary’s goaltender Jacob Deserres was clocked in the face by an errant knee after the ‘Birds stormed the net, resulting in the subsequent hack-in goal to be called back. Perhaps it was they hockey gods’ way of evening things out, considering the Dinos found themselves in a similar position on Friday night when a late third period goal was disallowed, forcing overtime.</p>

<p>The game got a bit chippy around the Calgary net from this point on, as the recent goalie contact lingered fresh in the Dinos’ minds. The refs tried to calm the after-whistle brouhahas immediately by doling out a couple of coincidental roughing minors, but the rough stuff would persist throughout. </p>
<p>Calgary made a strong push for most of the first period’s latter half, ringing three pucks off posts and denied repeatedly by Steven Stanford, the Thunderbird backup who looked like a 2003 Martin Brodeur with his slightly awkward, sometimes-standup-sometimes-butterfly style.</p>
<p>More post-whistle nonsense rounded out the opening frame as captain Ben Schmidt took exception to a late hit and gave Calgary’s Giffen Nyren a taste of his glove. The resulting UBC powerplay looked lacklustre, though, something Dragicevic bemoaned. “We lost the game because of the powerplay,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The effort was there; the execution was not.” </p>
<p>The period ended scoreless, but a fire had clearly been lit in the T-Birds’ bellies — fueled at least in part, in this reporter&#8217;s opinion, by the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/sports-review-314/" title="Women’s soccer and men’s hockey left dangling in initial sports review results" target="_blank">axe looming over their heads</a>.</p>
<p>The Twitter campaign to save the team has attracted a lot of passionate voices, and a few that carry weight: Canucks defenceman Kevin Bieksa, for one, lent his support, along with Colorado Avalanche defenceman and B.C. native Tyson Barrie and <em>Vancouver Sun</em> sports columnist Iain MacIntyre. The <em>Sun</em> published an article last Tuesday highlighting the absurdity of cutting the team, as well as the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-athletes-review-results239/" title="UBC athletes attempt to stay united after initial sports review results" target="_blank">players</a> and <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/coaches-review-reaction484/" title="UBC coaches react to initial sports review results" target="_blank">coaches’ understandable confusion</a> and iron resolve to remain a UBC staple.</p>
<p>After a 15-minute break, it was time to start the second. UBC began on the powerplay, continuing its just-OK performance without any real chances. After the Dinos took a boarding penalty three minutes in, the shorthanded team got the best chance with a blue line-in breakaway opportunity taken away beautifully by UBC’s Nick Buonassisi. </p>
<p>Defence wasn’t what the ‘Birds wanted to be practicing, especially with another powerplay chance a minute after the first one expired, but they were. Though the defence were solid and kept the shots to a minimum, Stanford stood on his head. “Stanny was great,” said Dragicevic, looking for positives in the game. “We kept the shots down [and] we kept them to the outside&#8230;. Those are encouraging things.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 12:29 that Calgary netted their first goal with a high shot tipped off the edge of Stanford’s glove and into the back of the net. The game-winner came just over four minutes later with a slapper from the point, one second after Buonassisi stepped out of the box from serving a high-sticking penalty. Stanford didn’t have a chance on either, the screen completely blocking his vision.</p>
<p>Remembering their impressive comeback the previous night, the Thunderbirds stormed out of the gate in the third and scored on the first shift. Luke Lockhart slammed in a hard pass from Geordie Wudrick in tight to make it 2-1. Wudrick is a new addition to the squad, an NHL draft pick of the Los Angeles Kings — he was selected 88th overall in 2008, but never signed a contract. </p>
<p>The crowd was back into it again. More frequent chants sprung up, and the team fed off of the energy, looking much more urgent in the Calgary zone. They looked like an entirely different team than in the previous two periods. </p>
<p>After a series of glorious opportunities, a powerplay at 15:36 seemed to be just the ticket to tie the game. They set up immediately, passed crisply and looked so immensely threatening that every shot drew a gasp from the stands. However, it was not to be. Calgary added an empty-netter with 30 seconds left to seal it. The ‘Birds fell to 8-13-1 while the Dinos improved to 20-0-2.</p>
<p>Though his team fell short, Dragicevic was impressed with their play and hopeful for the future. “This is the best, most skilled team we’ve had here in my time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When we get into the playoffs, nobody’s going to want to play us. We still control our own destiny.”</p>

<p>After suffering back-to-back losses to Alberta last weekend, the UBC women&#8217;s hockey team showed no signs of slowing down as they swept Manitoba this weekend for their 17th and 18th victories this season — a new school record.</p>
<p>On Friday night, Manitoba’s Kaitlin McDonald and UBC’s <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/capozzi-rafter-universiade670/" title="UBC’s Capozzi and Rafter set to hit the ice with Team Canada at 2013 Winter Universiade" target="_blank">Christi Capozzi and Tatiana Rafter</a> were all recognized for their gold-medal performance with Team Canada at the FISU Winter Universiade in Italy. </p>
<p>Then, just eight minutes into the first period, Thunderbird Nicole Saxvik opened the scoring, assisted by none other than Capozzi and Rafter themselves.</p>
<p>Three minutes into the second period, UBC extended their lead to 2-0 as Melissa Goodwin slotted the puck into the back of the net off a scramble in the crease. This was followed a minute later by a third goal from Emily O’Neill, assisted by Cailey Hay and Devon Morrison. </p>
<p>Manitoba were able to bite back near the halfway mark of the second period, chancing on a failed clearing attempt by UBC. </p>
<p>In the last minute of play of the second period, Manitoba pulled within a goal. “It was really close,&#8221; said UBC head coach Graham Thomas. &#8220;We have to tighten up.&#8221;</p>

<p>UBC soon got going again in the third period with Saxvik’s second goal of the night. The celebration was short-lived, though, as Manitoba scored a minute later, which would have brought the score to 4-3. The refs soon deemed this a non-goal, however, keeping the score 4-2 for UBC.</p>
<p>In the 12th minute, Rafter scored her 16th goal of the season off an assist from Hannah Heisler. The Thunderbirds followed with another goal in that same minute, this time from Rebecca Unrau, who was assisted by Morrison and Krista Wilson.</p>
<p>Manitoba snuck another one past Danielle Dube in the last minute of the third period, only slightly decreasing UBC&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>All in all, Thomas was still happy with the 6-3 win after the T-Birds&#8217; loss to the Pandas. “I thought there were some good moments where we played really well,” he said. &#8220;We’ll have to work harder, but we’re playing better hockey now. Manitoba’s a good team.&#8221;</p>
<p>UBC later went on to sweep the weekend when Krista Wilson scored her first CIS goal in the last minute of Saturday&#8217;s deadlocked 3-3 game. Their 18-5-1 record is already an improvement from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-womens-hockey-season-recap022/" title="UBC women’s hockey realized potential to become one of Canada’s top teams" target="_blank">historic season</a>, and there are still four regular season games remaining.</p>
<p>However, UBC is just two points ahead of Alberta in the Canada West standings, meaning they can&#8217;t afford to let up when they host the last-place Mount Royal Cougars (7-14-3) this weekend.</p>

<p>Looking to secure a playoff spot in the last stretch of the season, UBC men&#8217;s basketball is now 7-8 after a dominating 99-79 performance over the UNBC Timberwolves on Friday night. </p>
<p>UNBC simply had no answer for Tommy Nixon&#8217;s career-high 32 points. Nixon had already stacked up 22 points by halftime, going six for eight from the beyond the arc and not missing a single shot inside. This helped spur the Thunderbirds to a 16-2 run in the second quarter where they outscored UNBC 24–14. UBC held a comfortable 23-point lead by the end of the half.</p>
<p>“I’ve kind of been waiting for Tommy to have a breakout game this year,&#8221; said UBC head coach Kevin Hanson. &#8220;He came in and he got hot. I was really happy that Tommy was able to put that together. [He] played a great game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did Nixon have an exceptional shooting performance, he also finished with 10 rebounds, three blocks and had two of UBC’s eight steals in the game, all of which were team highs. His seven threes were just one shy of a UBC single-game record.</p>
<p>David Wagner and Tonner Jackson added 13 and 14 points respectively, both shooting well over 50 per cent from the field. Jackson also moved the ball well, dishing out eight assists.</p>
<p>As a team, UBC shot a sharp 54 per cent from the field and put up 32 assists, compared to a mere 15 for UNBC.</p>
<p>The one area the T-Birds struggled with was stopping Timberwolves forward Frank Olivier Kouagnia, a powerful inside presence who went eight for 11 from the field, leading his team with 24 points.</p>
<p>“They did some good things offensively and we made a few mental mistakes on our assignments defensively,&#8221; said Handson. &#8220;We have to clean up what we’re doing defensively and get a lot more help.”</p>
<p>With the prospect of securing a playoff spot in the Pacific division, one of UBC’s main concerns is the health of Brylle Kamen, who underwent elbow surgery over the winter break. Despite only playing 13 minutes in Friday&#8217;s game, he demonstrated just how effective he could be on the court, with skilled passing and scoring down low when needed. </p>
<p>“We’re trying to limit his minutes,” Hanson said of Kamen. “We have to be patient with him and he has to be patient with himself. When he gets going, he’s a great player. Tonight he had some great passes, so when he’s not scoring, he creates for other guys. We need him healthy and it’s just been a battle for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s win put UBC into a three-way tie with Trinity Western and Mount Royal for the fourth and final playoff spot in their division with seven games remaining.</p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s rematch with UNBC tips off at 7 p.m. at War Memorial Gym.</p>

<p>AMS presidential candidate Jackson Chen has been barred from campaigning between Jan. 29 and 31. </p>
<p>Chen was given this punishment today for repeated poster violations, including putting multiple posters on the same bulletin board and putting posters around Gage Residences on the front counter, tables and walls, which is not allowed. Chen&#8217;s Facebook profile picture also lacked the required AMS elections logo. </p>
<p>Chen said the poster violations were committed by a volunteer to whom he did not give the appropriate instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s my responsibility,&#8221; said Chen. &#8220;I didn’t tell him clearly beccause I’m pretty tired. I had too many things to do, so I just handed out the fliers and posters to him, but I told him to ask the front desk [at Gage], but obviously he didn’t ask the front desk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that when he uploaded his campaign poster to Facebook as a profile picture, he cropped the photo for size and didn&#8217;t realize he had cropped out the logo, which was on the side.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s just a mistake,&#8221; said Chen. &#8220;I didn’t know it was not included &#8230; [but] they shouldn’t control this stuff because it’s my personal stuff. It’s my profile picture, I can change [it] to anything I want.&#8221; </p>
<p>Chen said he intends to go to the AMS to appeal the decision to suspend his campaigning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just think it’s not so fair&#8230; I didn’t make such a big crime to deserve this kind of punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the safe zone after the recent <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/sports-review-314/" target="_blank">UBC sports review</a>, the women’s basketball team faced the UNBC Timberwolves this Friday in classic provincial rivalry fashion.</p>
<p>As the game progressed, UBC’s 4-10 northern counterpart didn’t stand a chance against the 9-5 Thunderbirds, and the game became an excellent opportunity for UBC head coach Deb Huband to get the team ready for the playoffs.</p>
<p>UBC&#8217;s 79-58 win was highlighted by an intense and diverse display of skill. Leading scorer Kris Young scored a game-high 18 points, and was closely trailed by guard Cassandra Knievel (17), forward Harleen Sidhu (14) and second-year Maggie Sundberg (12). Sundberg also made an impressive effort from beyond the arc, connecting on four consecutive three-pointers in the fourth quarter. In addition to her contribution in points, Sidhu nabbed eight rebounds, while Stephanie Bell grabbed seven.</p>
<p>The start of the game reflected the ladies’ strong play all season, with <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/harleen-sidhu-home-court128/" target="_blank">NCAA transfer Sidhu</a> scoring the game&#8217;s first points in a slick three-point play. Despite a few early blunders in attempts to score from behind the arc, turnover after turnover by UNBC had the Thunderbirds in near-constant possession of the ball, allowing for many opportunities for them to work on strong drives to the hoop and reversing around the key.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves were looking tired early on, while the Thunderbirds didn’t even appear to be breaking a sweat. Huband had chances to substitute a few bench players into the game, allowing the team to develop stronger support for the starters.</p>
<p>“You always need to play more than your starters,&#8221; Huband said. &#8220;There’s lots we still need to work on.&#8221;</p>
<p>She may, however, have been a little premature with the player rotations and could have waited for a larger lead before shuffling through substitutions. The Timberwolves saw the opening and the score became dangerously close around halftime, the visitors at one point even taking a significant lead. Putting pressure on the bench may have been a risky decision for Huband, but her team bounced back and became more consistent. </p>
<p>“In the second half of the game, our defense was better; [UNBC] stopped finishing &#8230; when they had over 50 per cent [shot percentage] in the first half,” said Huband.</p>
<p>First-year guard Cherub Lum displayed strong, controlled ball handling, preventing UNBC from getting a hand on the ball, and Young was as successful as ever in her efforts to drive through the Timberwolves’ zone defense and sink skillful layups. Nearly all inside maneuvers rewarded the Thunderbirds, whether from the initial baskets or from subsequent free throws. </p>
<p>As the final quarter rounded out, UNBC realized the consequences of letting go of their small score gap and the game turned scrappy. Jerseys were pulled and elbows were thrown, but an improving UBC defense held firm, and the Timberwolves couldn’t even touch the paint. </p>
<p>The win was a great opportunity to train the team — something that proved more useful than blowing UNBC out of the water with the starters.</p>

<p>An open house on Monday showcased the new Orchard Commons, one of many new mixed-use hubs set to open around UBC. </p>
<p>The site will cost an estimated $125.9 million, with construction expected to start this summer and finish by the summer of 2016. The Commons will be the home of the new <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/vantage-college-367/">Vantage College</a> program.</p>
<p>Vantage College will be a program for international first-year students who meet the academic requirements for UBC, but not necessarily the language requirements. </p>
<p>Jana Foit, the lead architect of the project, said the goal of the Commons is to get students immersed in UBC.</p>
<p>“It’s really to get them immersed in the culture and the community and to make sure they have every opportunity to speak English,&#8221; Foit said.</p>
<p>The Commons will have 1,048 beds dedicated to Vantage College students. Two single rooms will share one bathroom similar to the həm&#8217;ləsəm&#8217; and q&#8217;ələχən houses in Totem Park. However, Foit said that if the college does not meet its set enrolment targets, the residence may open up for other UBC students. All other amenities will be open for other UBC students.</p>
<p>The building itself will feature two residence towers, a dining hall with 350 seats, classrooms, study spaces, offices for staff, a convenience store, child care facilities and end-of-the-line facilities for cyclists. </p>
<p>Alannah Yip, a third-year engineering student, questioned the location of the Commons. “It seems like its its own college and I don&#8217;t see why it is in the middle of campus,” said Yip. </p>
<p>The Orchard Commons will be located on the northeast corner of West Mall and Agronomy Road. The site is currently occupied by the Orchard Garden, a community garden and outdoor classroom run by students in the Faculties of Land and Food Systems and Education. The garden will be moved to the Totem Park field. </p>
<p>Julia Ostertag, an Acadia Park resident involved with the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/opinion/katic-proposed-destruction-of-community-garden-emblematic-of-higher-ed-funding-problems/">Orchard Garden</a>, has been working with Campus and Community Planning to establish a new home for the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been difficult trying to find a permanent site. A lot of back and forth. There was a lot of uncertainty,&#8221; said Ostertag.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lose that proximity to campus [in the new Totem Park field location],&#8221; said Ostertag. “It was always the goal to have a site that is permanent, so we’re happy with that. However, it has been sad.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>The Ubyssey</em> has long had a special fondness for our university’s dear leader, Stephen J. Toope. A distinguished human rights lawyer and now renowned administrator, Toope has brought a progressive perspective to an often staid position: president of a very old university.</p>
<p>Now, though, we are saddened to learn that our very own Toope has <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/toope-u-of-t-235/" target="_blank">chosen the University of Toronto</a> as his new home. We are forced to ask whether that J stands not for John, but for Judas. When we found out last spring that Toope would be stepping down this year — best to leave while he still enjoyed it, he explained — we understood. But upon discovering that our precious Stephen views U of T — that dastardly eastern rival which represents the antithesis of all that is good in this word — as superior to our own institution, our hearts have broken to extent difficult to reconcile with our previous love.</p>
<p>We knew Toope — who, in his humble charm, prefers to be addressed as Professor Toope rather than Dr. Toope — wanted to return to academia, and he is doing so as director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at U of T. But need we remind the professor that UBC itself has plenty of options for a return to academia? For a man who spent his term as president trying to improve UBC’s academic standing in the world, to leave us for a competitor is nothing less than betrayal.</p>
<p>We put our faith — nay, our full trust, to say nothing of love, into this man, only for him to turn our backs on us for supposedly greener, if snowier, pastures out east. Suffice it to say that our too-short love affair (aren’t they always) with Steve has ended.</p>
<p>It is still to early to properly digest our feelings on the matter. Indeed, perhaps Norman Rush put it best when he wrote, “I feel like someone after a deluge being asked to describe the way it was before the flood while I’m still plucking seaweed out of my hair.”</p>
<p>Life with the knowledge that Toope will soon be academiating in Toronto while we slave away in the Vancouver rain is not something we can yet fully describe. But nor can we explain exactly what it is we are losing.</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Koerner&#8217;s ain&#8217;t all that, kids</h3>
<p>Though we appreciate our food writer&#8217;s enthusiasm for <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/culture/koerners-pub-healthier-menu521/" target="_blank">Koerner&#8217;s Pub</a> and its reworked menu, we would — pardon the pun — like to add just a touch of salt to her verdict.</p>
<p>Before it shut down for renovations a few years ago, the atmosphere in Koerner&#8217;s was convivial; though a bit crowded, the decor, the lighting and the space itself conveyed a traditional student pub sentimentality. It felt, you might say, &#8220;lived-in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not so after last year&#8217;s re-opening. The proprietors of Koerner&#8217;s have marketed their establishment towards a more stylized, postmodern student mindset. The problem is that it plays to this mindset right down to a tee.</p>
<p>The warm ambiance of the old bar has been replaced with a more sterile aesthetic. The drink menu, provided on clipboards, is filled with clever self-awareness: PBR is described as a &#8220;cheap and shitty lager,&#8221; Jager Bombs are deemed &#8220;bad decisions,&#8221; and water — which is served in a Mason jar rather than a glass — is referred to as &#8220;dihydrogen monoxide.&#8221; Rather than pitchers, one pours their beer out of a growler bottle, which must be hoisted over the shoulder and poured, Athenian-style, into a cup. And the televisions, for whatever reason, play Bill Murray films ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Being owned by the Graduate Student Society, it only makes sense that Koerner&#8217;s would evoke a quasi-cynical attitude in its menu and decor; they can hardly be faulted for appealing to their target demographic. We only wish the pub wouldn&#8217;t beat us over the head with the fact that we are poor, miserable students who, paradoxically, also need to spend a fortune on organic food and artisanal alcohols in order to justify our education.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Debates kind of a snorefest</h3>
<p>So far, this year&#8217;s AMS elections debates have left a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>On Monday, both <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/vp-external-missing-325/" target="_blank">VP external</a> candidates missed their debating slots, which didn&#8217;t make for much interesting discussion.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/2014-presidential-debate-235/" target="_blank">presidential</a> and <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/bog-debate-235/" target="_blank">BoG candidates</a> had more lively debates, the moderator allowed for few questions, shutting out many audience members — including our reporters.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s debates had a different moderator, but less than impressive questions. At one point, the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/clubs-subs-admin-debate-354/" target="_blank">VP admin</a> candidates were asked about the VP admin and university affairs portfolio, which doesn&#8217;t exist. The moderator later asked the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/student-senate-debate235/" target="_blank">Senate candidates</a> which other candidates in their race they would vote for, only to be cut off by the elections administrator before he had to issue slating violations.</p>
<p>We hope the final AMS debate on Monday will be better organized and give more audience members a chance to participate.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">What makes a team varsity?</h3>
<p>The results of the first phase of the UBC sports review were <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/sports-review-314/" target="_blank">announced yesterday</a>, with 16 teams being guaranteed varsity status. The number was surprisingly high, which suggests that perhaps more teams than originally thought reach the designed varsity criteria, but there were some curious omissions on the first list.</p>
<p>The teams who are safe don&#8217;t really come as a surprise. Basketball, football and women&#8217;s volleyball were locks from the start, and while some may raise an eyebrow at rowing, cross-country and track and field, those teams regularly produce national team members and achieve consistent success at the <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/naia-xc013/" target="_blank">university level</a>. But women&#8217;s soccer, men&#8217;s hockey and men&#8217;s volleyball not being on the list has led to some furrowed brows and even some outrage.</p>
<p>The main takeaway appears to be that the varsity teams are the most well-rounded ones. While many of the teams left off the list have had recent success — <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/mens-vball-sweeps-bobcats115/" target="_blank">men&#8217;s volleyball</a>, women&#8217;s soccer, <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-baseball-season-preview-213/" target="_blank">baseball</a>, men&#8217;s field hockey men&#8217;s, <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/ubc-alpine-skiing201/" target="_blank">skiing</a>, softball and <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/sports/womens-golf-national-champs-829/" target="_blank">women&#8217;s golf</a> — they clearly lack in areas such as &#8220;fit with university tradition&#8221; and &#8220;community support and tradition&#8221; (although that still doesn&#8217;t explain women&#8217;s soccer, which is one of Canada&#8217;s fastest growing sports and has a Canadian soccer legend for a coach). </p>
<p>And while men&#8217;s hockey and women&#8217;s rugby might have support and tradition, they lack recent success; men&#8217;s hockey has only two playoff series wins in more than 40 years, and women&#8217;s rugby is 5-15 over the past five years.</p>
<p>A few more teams are expected to be added, so some teams still have hope. But since these teams now have a better idea of how to meet the criteria, perhaps the second phase will also produce more varsity teams than originally thought.</p>

<p>The AMS has suspended Hempology 101&#8242;s SUB booking privileges in response to a <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/ubc-hempology-club-sub-494/">vaporizer session</a> they hosted on Jan. 10.</p>
<p>The Student Administrative Commission (SAC) issued the punishment after talking to the club at a meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Running a club, especially a newer club, can be a slightly daunting process, and everyone makes mistakes,&#8221; said SAC vice-chair Nina Scott. &#8220;This was an unfortunate one. We&#8217;re happy to work more closely with them &#8230; and help them make sure something like this doesn&#8217;t happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The club&#8217;s booking privileges have been suspended until the end of April.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re kicked out of the SUB entirely, just that we essentially are denied privacy for a semester,&#8221; said Hempology 101 treasurer Corbin Manson.</p>
<p>The club will still be able to host events outside the SUB.</p>
<p>&#8220;What they do off campus on their own time with their own financial means in their own group is completely up to them. We have absolutely no interest in silencing them or taking any extreme punitive action,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>Manson said that although the club&#8217;s booking privileges are suspended, the AMS will still let them host the hemp convention they have planned for March.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to negotiate a room for out cannabis convention in March, which is the most important event of the year, so I&#8217;m really happy that they still are going to be giving us space for the big convention,&#8221; said Manson.</p>
<p>Scott said SAC plans to work with Hempology 101 to help them boost their image on campus, and that neither campus security nor the RCMP are seeking any legal action against them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We absolutely don&#8217;t want to take away their right to free speech. Whatever they want to say is fine by us, and we want to help make sure they get their message across and they&#8217;re portrayed in the light they want to be,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>Manson said SAC encouraged his club to set up tables in the SUB to help spread their message about cannabis education.</p>
<p>&#8220;A table is a great way to do education and outreach because it&#8217;s so visible,&#8221; Manson said. &#8220;We want to do things centred around hemp and cannabis education and also just wellness in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a meeting coming up on Friday and we&#8217;ll be able to hash out more concrete plans as to how we want to approach tabling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manson said the club is working to organize their March conference and to improve their image after the vaporizer session.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be lying low for a little bit now that all of this has played out. We&#8217;re going to be looking at how we can move forward. As a club, we still have some repurposing, maybe, that we need to be doing before we can have anything concrete happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello, fellow human being:  </p>
<p>Your reporting of Hempology 101&#8242;s civil disobedience is unfortunate. It smacks of misinformation and oppression. You know that whatever hurts others hurts you. So it is when the most progressive institutes do not support peaceful civil disobedience against unjust laws. </p>
<p>Those who oppose tyranny must creatively change bad laws by drawing attention to their cruelty and absurdity. If we are to have a society which reflects the will of the people on cannabis, we must challenge the present marijuana laws. We wouldn&#8217;t be alone doing so.</p>
<p>Why, even the United Nations delegates are walking away from enforcing the militancy of the War on Drugs, because they see a need to stop hurtful action and to restore peace. At UBC, these vaporizing people are providing awareness you can&#8217;t teach in a classroom. By harassing them, you slow the pace of change. Next time you think about the coffee vapour coming off the rim of your cup, think of the vapour that for a moment spread freedom through the halls of the SUB. Be glad that a few brave students are forging compassionate social change with a healthful herb and prompting political awareness at the university.  </p>
<p>Let them, for a few seconds, while contained in a small spot, vaporize without fear of the police or suffering personal or career loss. I salute the courage of those who oppose oppression. We are all either for the Redcoats or for freedom. Make no mistake: this is a war on people, and Harper has prisons hungry for young occupants. You decide if you want to pass this war on to your friends and children. All should stand up for the activities of Hempology 101 as they march toward the dissolution of enforcement myths and the immorality of a bad law. Smart people should spotlight the corruption which serves the War on Drugs by showing support for the activities of Hempology 101.  </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
