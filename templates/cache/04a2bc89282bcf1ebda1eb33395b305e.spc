Originality is key, and Victoria’s Migration Boutique is nothing if not original. Formerly known as Lotus, this innovative shop on the main floor of the Bay Centre Mall in downtown Victoria draws in stylish urbanites with an eye for locally produced goods and tourists looking for one-of-a-kind West Coast souvenirs. It was renamed “Migration” by owner and creative director, Sara Patterson, to reflect the store’s migratory spirit and her creative flair for travel and fair trade. According to the manager of Migration (and fellow designer), Angelica Reid, the shop has been moving around the Bay Centre for about five years, although Patterson has been in the fashion, accessory and home décor industry for the last ten years. She started selling products at local markets and festivals, and then decided to test out the concept of a “pop-up shop” by operating a temporary boutique in the mall during the months of November and December exclusively. The last two years have seen Migration exist on a more permanent basis when “[Sara] decided to keep it open for six [months] and now she’s going even longer,” said Reid. When asked about future plans, Reid commented that Migration will be in its current location until at least May 2014. “Ideally we’re staying there [the mall] because we expose so many people to this concept there.” And with its rapidly growing popularity, hopefully its doors will be open during the coming summer and fall months. In addition to its on-the-move appeal is the fact that Migration stocks over 40 designers, with a special focus on local trend-setting companies. Brands like Floating Gold Iceberg, Bonspiel Creations, Quench Designs and BoPeepBaby, among others, come from around the Lower Mainland and the Greater Victoria areas to make their home at Migration. The store displays hundreds of items, from handmade jewelry, to homemade kitchen sauces, to of-the-moment handbags and clothing created from ethically sourced materials. From adorable baby clothes to en vogue women’s fashion to men’s t-shirts, they’ve truly got it all. Lines from brands like Morena and Trapper Jane Clothing have helped to establish their versatility and ability to showcase both ends of the fashion spectrum. “Trapper Jane has just a really subdued kind of aesthetic. They’re basics, but they’re cut so nicely. Morena has this crazy artistic poetry to everything that she makes and pieces together as one-of-a-kind,” said Reid. When it comes to all the stock on the walls, its designers and its origins, Patterson is a big proponent of supporting small businesses, fair trade and ethical sourcing. While many of Migration’s competitors carry fashionable finds in the same categories and price ranges, they cannot always boast that their goods were ethically sourced and locally produced. With Reid and Patterson at the helm, this store has a different trade philosophy than most. “We’ve had to turn [designers] away if we question where their things are coming from or how they’re assembled. We’ve certainly returned stock before,” said Reid. On the store website Patterson is honest about her business approach and mentality, writing, “Buyers like me have the choice to purchase items that are mass produced and made in an unethical manner or to seek out talented individuals to make sure they receive a fair wage for their work.” Although there are definite challenges that come with the its “pop-up” set up, namely the construction and deconstruction of Migration’s displays and store layout, it is a concept that keeps shoppers coming back. The Migration team works extra hard on promotion and making sure their customers know their latest address. Their current location is the fifth stop for Migration and if the growing number of customers and in-stock designers are any indication, this unique boutique has more than a few fans hoping for a permanent roost announcement in the spring. Migration’s official launch, which is slated for April / May 2014, will be celebrated with a party of the most trendy variety. “She [Patterson] is a party planner. It’s going to be huge!” said Reid, with a laugh. “All the designers will be there. [...] In either February or March we’ll also do a meet-the-designers night.

The cloud cover broke and allowed the April sun to warm me from above. I closed my eyes, lifted my face toward the heat, and let that warmth soothe my doubt.  The air smelled of spring freshness and moisture. A bird sang sweetly somewhere overhead. This might not be so bad after all. Then the first wave of cars crested the hill and accelerated toward me. I opened my eyes and, stepping back off the line, watched the vehicles surge forward. Sedans and SUVs, pickup trucks, minivans and a motor home. Their rush blew wind up into my face, causing my chin-length curls to writhe like the snakes of Medusa. I stepped farther back from the road. The weight of my pack encouraged this motion and I nearly stumbled. “What’s the problem?” my friend Bennett asked. He was up the highway a bit and had to yell for me to hear him over the din. “Get your thumb out.” Bennett stood facing the oncoming traffic. He walked backward slowly, sure steps keeping him moving and upright, and held a rigid thumb out over the road. He had his pack hiked high up around his shoulders. “You won’t get picked up just standing there.” I turned back. The traffic was thin again, probably held up at the light beyond the ridge. But the next round would soon be upon us. I put my arm out—almost parallel to my body—and poked my thumb up. “C’mon,” yelled Bennett. “Get it up. No one can see that.” I got my arm perpendicular to my body this time and I thrust my thumb toward those thundering vehicles. But in the 100-kilometre-an-hour stretch of highway between Victoria and Colwood, cars come a-flying. One slight veer and I could lose my hand. Heck, I could lose my life. I inched off the shoulder line once again. At first it felt as though each person who sped past glared at me. They saw me as they approached and scrunched their faces in distaste. Families, kids, grandparents—all passing judgement. “Look at that bum,” they thought. “Freeloader can’t pay his own way. Probably wants to rob us.” I thought of my own grandparents then. They wouldn’t be too happy if they knew I was hitchhiking up Island. Probably wouldn’t pick me up, either. I reached down and felt the pre-rolled joint in my pocket. That’s what I needed. “Hey Bennett,” I called over my shoulder. “Let’s blaze this thing.” “No.” “It’ll be a lot more fun.” But he was more disciplined than I. “No. Save it till we get scooped.” Code of the road, I was told before we left: Always have a doobie to share with the driver. I liked the idea of that, I did, but I also liked the idea of getting high—right now. As I stood out there, walking my way backwards along the road, I examined the cars. We’d been out here 10 minutes already and not even a sniff. Vehicles blasted by with no more than a single driver occupying the insides. So much room. Was it too much to ask for one of the many near-empty cars to pull over and pick us up? “Why don’t any of them stop?” I yelled. “It’s not like they don’t have room.” “Be patient,” said Bennett. While this was my first attempt at thumbing, Bennett had done it a few times before. Because he was going to school at UVic, hitchhiking was a viable way to get home to Powell River—he just had to get up Island to Comox and take the ferry from there. A single highway. That was it. For me, going to school at Simon Fraser University made hitchhiking to Powell River a much more arduous journey. If I didn’t make a connector, I’d be pooched at an empty ferry terminal overnight. I’d heard how fun (and economical) hitchhiking home could be. I wanted to try it. So when Bennett called me up and told me a few of our friends at Malaspina College in Nanaimo planned to throw a real shaker, that was it. The plan was to head up there for the party, then make our way to Powell River together the next day. But until Bennett and I caught a bloody ride, none of our plans could begin. We kept at it for some time. Metre upon paved metre passed beneath our heels. My arm got tired after a while. At least it didn’t feel like the drivers were judging me anymore. Now I just felt like I was invisible. I heard Bennett’s voice from behind me. “Spencer Road’s just a little farther. Subway there. Bathroom break.” I had been told that a place called Spencer was the best spot to get picked up leaving Victoria. Not only were the drivers at this section of Highway 1 likely heading over the Malahat, but a merge lane from Burnside and an intersection from the Sooke turnoff both converged here as well. We got subs and ate them inside. “So. What you think?” asked Bennett between bites. “Sucks.” “C’mon.” “No one stops.” “They will, young Padawan. They will.” Bennett grinned his goofy, toothy grin. He had the mouth of a horse, full of teeth all strong at the front. He was the only guy I knew who still rocked the mushroom cut—a style that had gone out during middle school so many years before. The undershave went high and his top hair dropped down past his ears. He wasn’t ready to let grunge die. I, on the other hand, had a head full of curls. Bennett liked to make fun of these curls, oddly enough. I made fun of his height. At 5’9, he was just a little guy. Stocky as hell, but short nonetheless. If we were both standing, I could rest my chin on his scalp—not that he’d ever let me get that close. He’d have me in an ankle-lock submission before I got within a foot. We finished our subs and walked back out. It turns out the sun had said adieu while we were eating; the clouds had returned with a vengeance. Now they were dark, sinister things, roiling overhead. “Doesn’t look good,” said Bennett. “Better smoke that joint then.” He eyed me a moment, then made for the highway without stopping. “But it’ll be raining soon,” I called after him. “We won’t be able to light it.” It was then that it started to rain. We stood out on that stretch for a while, watching cars merge and turn and drive on by, waiting for one—just one—to flip its blinker and pull over. Within 15 minutes, my feet were wet. Fifteen minutes after that, my clothes were stuck to me. “This sucks,” I muttered, blowing water off the end of my nose. Should’ve smoked the joint when we had the chance. I checked to see how wet it was. Just then a car horn that sounded like the Road Runner made me look up, and there, coming from the Sooke turnoff across the highway, bombed a beat-up little Chevette. It barrelled through the intersection and cut across both lanes of the highway, skidding onto the shoulder ahead of us. I might have thought the maneuver reckless, if I wasn’t so elated that the car was stopping for us. Rust covered the side panels, and the exhaust pipe rattled, even while in idle, but none of that mattered. We had a ride. He honked again and Bennett and I jogged toward him, our packs swaying on our backs. The car was a two-door, and we quickly saw the back was full of junk—clothes, boxes, and a tool kit. I even thought I saw part of a fishing rod protruding from the mass. The driver leaned over and pushed the door. It squealed in protest as it opened. “Damn rain,” he said. “Not good for nothin’.” His southern drawl was unmistakable. He had long, dark grey hair tied up in a ponytail and a matching, ratty beard. Through his beard I could see a gap in the top row of his teeth—not one of the big two, but it could have been a canine. “Little guy’s gonna have to get in the back.” Bennett grumbled. I put a fist to my mouth to keep from laughing. Once Bennett managed to clear a spot on the seat, he crawled in. There wouldn’t be much foot room in the front, either, so I passed him my bigger hiking bag and brought his daypack into the front with me. Our driver had to pump the gas pedal some before the car got moving again. “Not used to all this weight,” he said, looking back at Bennett through the rear view. I bit my lip and looked out the window. “So where you boys headed, anyhow?” “Nanaimo,” I said, feeling my pocket. I didn’t know how long the requisite wait period was, but the sooner I pulled the joint, the happier this guy would be. For sure. And then I saw it: a bumper sticker on the glove compartment door that read: No Puffin. A red circle with a line through it covered the picture of a puffin. Kind of like the Ghostbusters emblem. The puffin had a smoke in its mouth. I groaned inwardly. All the people who could have stopped and it had to be this guy. Unreal. “Nanaimo, eh?” he said, drawing out the eh. “You going that far?” asked Bennett. “Going that far? Boy, I’m going to Alaska.” He put a real emphasis on that last word. “In this thing?” Again the man peered at Bennett through the rear view. He squinted beneath his bushy eyebrows. “You got a problem with my car?” “No. Not at all. That just seems like a long way.” The driver looked back at the road. “Well, it is a long way. And I should warn you boys, wipers are on the fritz.” I glanced back at Bennett. He didn’t look pleased. “Hoping this rain lets off a bit,” added the man. “They seem fine to me,” I ventured. “Oh yeah, they are. For now. Usually got a good hour in ‘em. Been on about half an hour now, though. We’ll see.” “And what happens if they stop?” asked Bennett. The man snorted as if that was the dumbest question he ever heard. “We stop and fix ‘em. What else?” If I were a religious man I would have thanked God that we made it over the Malahat before they stopped. Well, almost made it. We were buzzing through the home stretch, heading downhill toward Brentwood Bay when they stopped for the first time. They’d been going, going, going, and then they just stopped. The rain came down in droves. “God-dammit!” the driver hissed. We’d been in the fast lane and he slowed abruptly. This action was met by an angry honk from behind. “Motherfucker,” he said, more to himself than anyone. He got into the slow lane and the cars behind us sped past. The people in them surely gave us the finger and shook their fists, but I kept my eyes on the opposite window. “Hey!” said the driver, pleased. I looked ahead and the wipers were going again. “Back in business.” Business, as it were, lasted eight seconds. “Fuck!” He leaned forward to try and see through the curtain of water pelting down on the windshield. “Not sure if this’ll work.” “You think?” muttered Bennett under his breath. He didn’t look pleased. We made it to the gas station just before Duncan. Our driver popped the hood and played around with some things, whistling to himself all the while. We stayed in the car. “This guy’s insane,” said Bennett. “He doesn’t even puff. Look at this bumper sticker.” Bennett leaned forward and read it. “Who cares? I just want to get there in one piece.” He shook his head. “Alaska? Honestly?” We got going again, but had only gone a few clicks before the wipers frapped out again. We drove slowly into Duncan and stopped at the first gas station. The man looked at us. “Either you boys good at mechanics?” I watched Bennett lean over the hood and fiddle about. He’d been a car guy for as long as I’d known him, ever since elementary school. He and his dad used to debate Ford and Chevy at the supper table. If anyone was going to get the wipers working, it would be Bennett. After a while, he and the driver got back in the car. We had made it through Duncan, but that was it. By now the wipers were hardly going at all. We stopped at yet another gas station and the three of us got out. The driver bought some of that water bead-off stuff from inside. “Maybe this’ll work. Gotta get the windshield good and dry though.” We each grabbed a couple handfuls of paper towel and scrubbed the windshield. We scrubbed until it was good and dry. Then driver poured the fluid over. “Gotta wait till she dries, till it soaks into the glass. Says half an hour.” We waited there for half an hour, hardly speaking, listening to the rain thump onto the roof overhead. By the time we got going again the sky had darkened. We quickly discovered the bead-off stuff didn’t work. At least not during a downpour. “Really thought that would work,” said the driver. I could feel Bennett’s disdain permeating from the back seat. “All right, boys. Gonna need you to work the wipers. It’s the only way.” Now it was my turn to contribute. I hoisted my torso out the window and ran the wiper across the shield as best I could. Since I couldn’t reach the far side, the man had to lean over the centre console to see out my partially cleared side. We went like that from Cowichan through to Ladysmith until the rain let up just before we reached Nanaimo. The speedometer didn’t pass 40 kilometres per hour once. We arrived just after 11 p.m., even though we’d been picked up just after 2 p.m., meaning it took us nine hours to span 100 kilometres. Our driver dropped us off near Malaspina College where our friends had long since started the party. Bennett and I grabbed our stuff from the car and trudged away. I don’t think we even said goodbye to the old guy. I wonder if he ever made it to Alaska.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13440:"I stood there, straddling the white line that separated shoulder from highway, wondering whether I actually wanted to do this.

No one can see that.” I got my arm perpendicular to my body this time and I thrust my thumb toward those thundering vehicles. But in the 100-kilometre-an-hour stretch of highway between Victoria and Colwood, cars come a-flying. One slight veer and I could lose my hand. Heck, I could lose my life. I inched off the shoulder line once again. At first it felt as though each person who sped past glared at me. They saw me as they approached and scrunched their faces in distaste. Families, kids, grandparents—all passing judgement. “Look at that bum,” they thought. “Freeloader can’t pay his own way. Probably wants to rob us.” I thought of my own grandparents then. They wouldn’t be too happy if they knew I was hitchhiking up Island. Probably wouldn’t pick me up, either. I reached down and felt the pre-rolled joint in my pocket. That’s what I needed. “Hey Bennett,” I called over my shoulder. “Let’s blaze this thing.” “No.” “It’ll be a lot more fun.” But he was more disciplined than I. “No. Save it till we get scooped.” Code of the road, I was told before we left: Always have a doobie to share with the driver. I liked the idea of that, I did, but I also liked the idea of getting high—right now. As I stood out there, walking my way backwards along the road, I examined the cars. We’d been out here 10 minutes already and not even a sniff. Vehicles blasted by with no more than a single driver occupying the insides. So much room. Was it too much to ask for one of the many near-empty cars to pull over and pick us up? “Why don’t any of them stop?” I yelled. “It’s not like they don’t have room.” “Be patient,” said Bennett. While this was my first attempt at thumbing, Bennett had done it a few times before. Because he was going to school at UVic, hitchhiking was a viable way to get home to Powell River—he just had to get up Island to Comox and take the ferry from there. A single highway. That was it. For me, going to school at Simon Fraser University made hitchhiking to Powell River a much more arduous journey. If I didn’t make a connector, I’d be pooched at an empty ferry terminal overnight. I’d heard how fun (and economical) hitchhiking home could be. I wanted to try it. So when Bennett called me up and told me a few of our friends at Malaspina College in Nanaimo planned to throw a real shaker, that was it. The plan was to head up there for the party, then make our way to Powell River together the next day. But until Bennett and I caught a bloody ride, none of our plans could begin. We kept at it for some time. Metre upon paved metre passed beneath our heels. My arm got tired after a while. At least it didn’t feel like the drivers were judging me anymore. Now I just felt like I was invisible. I heard Bennett’s voice from behind me. “Spencer Road’s just a little farther. Subway there. Bathroom break.” I had been told that a place called Spencer was the best spot to get picked up leaving Victoria. Not only were the drivers at this section of Highway 1 likely heading over the Malahat, but a merge lane from Burnside and an intersection from the Sooke turnoff both converged here as well. We got subs and ate them inside. “So. What you think?” asked Bennett between bites. “Sucks.” “C’mon.” “No one stops.” “They will, young Padawan. They will.” Bennett grinned his goofy, toothy grin. He had the mouth of a horse, full of teeth all strong at the front. He was the only guy I knew who still rocked the mushroom cut—a style that had gone out during middle school so many years before. The undershave went high and his top hair dropped down past his ears. He wasn’t ready to let grunge die. I, on the other hand, had a head full of curls. Bennett liked to make fun of these curls, oddly enough. I made fun of his height. At 5’9, he was just a little guy. Stocky as hell, but short nonetheless. If we were both standing, I could rest my chin on his scalp—not that he’d ever let me get that close. He’d have me in an ankle-lock submission before I got within a foot. We finished our subs and walked back out. It turns out the sun had said adieu while we were eating; the clouds had returned with a vengeance. Now they were dark, sinister things, roiling overhead. “Doesn’t look good,” said Bennett. “Better smoke that joint then.” He eyed me a moment, then made for the highway without stopping. “But it’ll be raining soon,” I called after him. “We won’t be able to light it.” It was then that it started to rain. We stood out on that stretch for a while, watching cars merge and turn and drive on by, waiting for one—just one—to flip its blinker and pull over. Within 15 minutes, my feet were wet. Fifteen minutes after that, my clothes were stuck to me. “This sucks,” I muttered, blowing water off the end of my nose. Should’ve smoked the joint when we had the chance. I checked to see how wet it was. Just then a car horn that sounded like the Road Runner made me look up, and there, coming from the Sooke turnoff across the highway, bombed a beat-up little Chevette. It barrelled through the intersection and cut across both lanes of the highway, skidding onto the shoulder ahead of us. I might have thought the maneuver reckless, if I wasn’t so elated that the car was stopping for us. Rust covered the side panels, and the exhaust pipe rattled, even while in idle, but none of that mattered. We had a ride. He honked again and Bennett and I jogged toward him, our packs swaying on our backs. The car was a two-door, and we quickly saw the back was full of junk—clothes, boxes, and a tool kit. I even thought I saw part of a fishing rod protruding from the mass. The driver leaned over and pushed the door. It squealed in protest as it opened. “Damn rain,” he said. “Not good for nothin’.” His southern drawl was unmistakable. He had long, dark grey hair tied up in a ponytail and a matching, ratty beard. Through his beard I could see a gap in the top row of his teeth—not one of the big two, but it could have been a canine. “Little guy’s gonna have to get in the back.” Bennett grumbled. I put a fist to my mouth to keep from laughing. Once Bennett managed to clear a spot on the seat, he crawled in. There wouldn’t be much foot room in the front, either, so I passed him my bigger hiking bag and brought his daypack into the front with me. Our driver had to pump the gas pedal some before the car got moving again. “Not used to all this weight,” he said, looking back at Bennett through the rear view. I bit my lip and looked out the window. “So where you boys headed, anyhow?” “Nanaimo,” I said, feeling my pocket. I didn’t know how long the requisite wait period was, but the sooner I pulled the joint, the happier this guy would be. For sure. And then I saw it: a bumper sticker on the glove compartment door that read: No Puffin. A red circle with a line through it covered the picture of a puffin. Kind of like the Ghostbusters emblem. The puffin had a smoke in its mouth. I groaned inwardly. All the people who could have stopped and it had to be this guy. Unreal. “Nanaimo, eh?” he said, drawing out the eh. “You going that far?” asked Bennett. “Going that far? Boy, I’m going to Alaska.” He put a real emphasis on that last word. “In this thing?” Again the man peered at Bennett through the rear view. He squinted beneath his bushy eyebrows. “You got a problem with my car?” “No. Not at all. That just seems like a long way.” The driver looked back at the road. “Well, it is a long way. And I should warn you boys, wipers are on the fritz.” I glanced back at Bennett. He didn’t look pleased. “Hoping this rain lets off a bit,” added the man. “They seem fine to me,” I ventured. “Oh yeah, they are. For now. Usually got a good hour in ‘em. Been on about half an hour now, though. We’ll see.” “And what happens if they stop?” asked Bennett. The man snorted as if that was the dumbest question he ever heard. “We stop and fix ‘em. What else?” If I were a religious man I would have thanked God that we made it over the Malahat before they stopped. Well, almost made it. We were buzzing through the home stretch, heading downhill toward Brentwood Bay when they stopped for the first time. They’d been going, going, going, and then they just stopped. The rain came down in droves. “God-dammit!” the driver hissed. We’d been in the fast lane and he slowed abruptly. This action was met by an angry honk from behind. “Motherfucker,” he said, more to himself than anyone. He got into the slow lane and the cars behind us sped past. The people in them surely gave us the finger and shook their fists, but I kept my eyes on the opposite window. “Hey!” said the driver, pleased. I looked ahead and the wipers were going again. “Back in business.” Business, as it were, lasted eight seconds. “Fuck!” He leaned forward to try and see through the curtain of water pelting down on the windshield. “Not sure if this’ll work.” “You think?” muttered Bennett under his breath. He didn’t look pleased. We made it to the gas station just before Duncan. Our driver popped the hood and played around with some things, whistling to himself all the while. We stayed in the car. “This guy’s insane,” said Bennett. “He doesn’t even puff. Look at this bumper sticker.” Bennett leaned forward and read it. “Who cares? I just want to get there in one piece.” He shook his head. “Alaska? Honestly?” We got going again, but had only gone a few clicks before the wipers frapped out again. We drove slowly into Duncan and stopped at the first gas station. The man looked at us. “Either you boys good at mechanics?” I watched Bennett lean over the hood and fiddle about. He’d been a car guy for as long as I’d known him, ever since elementary school. He and his dad used to debate Ford and Chevy at the supper table. If anyone was going to get the wipers working, it would be Bennett. After a while, he and the driver got back in the car. We had made it through Duncan, but that was it. By now the wipers were hardly going at all. We stopped at yet another gas station and the three of us got out. The driver bought some of that water bead-off stuff from inside. “Maybe this’ll work. Gotta get the windshield good and dry though.” We each grabbed a couple handfuls of paper towel and scrubbed the windshield. We scrubbed until it was good and dry. Then driver poured the fluid over. “Gotta wait till she dries, till it soaks into the glass. Says half an hour.” We waited there for half an hour, hardly speaking, listening to the rain thump onto the roof overhead. By the time we got going again the sky had darkened. We quickly discovered the bead-off stuff didn’t work. At least not during a downpour. “Really thought that would work,” said the driver. I could feel Bennett’s disdain permeating from the back seat. “All right, boys. Gonna need you to work the wipers. It’s the only way.” Now it was my turn to contribute. I hoisted my torso out the window and ran the wiper across the shield as best I could. Since I couldn’t reach the far side, the man had to lean over the centre console to see out my partially cleared side. We went like that from Cowichan through to Ladysmith until the rain let up just before we reached Nanaimo. The speedometer didn’t pass 40 kilometres per hour once. We arrived just after 11 p.m., even though we’d been picked up just after 2 p.m., meaning it took us nine hours to span 100 kilometres. Our driver dropped us off near Malaspina College where our friends had long since started the party. Bennett and I grabbed our stuff from the car and trudged away. I don’t think we even said goodbye to the old guy. I wonder if he ever made it to Alaska.";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"

<p>SOS-McGill, representing concerned students, faculty, and staff, has been mobilizing to stop the PPP since November. We agree with Manfredi that the PPP will bring historic large scale reorganization in the Faculty of Arts, but we insist that the plan in its current form and with the current process is seriously flawed.</p>
<p>To date, constructive criticism of the idea to conglomerate support staff from 13 departments into new administrative service centres has been silenced. This was the case when Manfredi ignored the Faculty of Arts’ vote against the PPP last April and the current letter in The Daily is, unfortunately, another example. After declaring our concerns misleading, Manfredi concludes by suggesting SOS-McGill undervalues the skills of our support staff. This claim attempts to disregard the validity of questions posed by students, faculty and staff of the PPP.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the PPP has been presented before numerous working groups for over a year. However, the consultations that have taken place among committee members do not absolve Manfredi of the responsibility of engaging with legitimate concerns arising from the departments. In addition, given the fact that the unions of affected staff have yet to be consulted, there have clearly not been enough meetings.</p>
<p>According to Manfredi, the PPP offers staff a reasonable learning curve, but these are empty claims as he has yet to address repeated requests for evidence of the expected outcomes of the proposed hubbing. Given the case study of the University of Manchester (as described by <a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/04/maybe-its-just-a-ploy-for-a-game-of-extreme-musical-chairs/">Professor Amelia Jones</a>), lasting damages to departmental culture and student services are all likely outcomes that cannot be downplayed in the face of short-term budgetary woes.</p>
<p>We agree the PPP is about more than staff reorganization. We also see that the PPP creates a new level of bureaucracy, further changing the culture of community within our departments. Academic support staff, in some cases under the PPP, will be required to become expert advisors of four departments at once. Students will not only see changes in their interactions with academic support staff, but also with departmental chairs and academic advisors – all of whom face increased responsibilities under the PPP.</p>
<p>At the January 14 town hall organized by SOS-McGill, many expressed the need for the administration to release hard data and declared its absence to be purposely vague. While Manfredi took the time to express the consultation statistics of the PPP, much of the financial and logistic details of the plan remain mired in secrecy. Consequently, we ask again for a revised budget to be posted on the PPP website, as promised by Manfredi in December.</p>
<p>We also demand that the alternative plans, developed autonomously by several department chairs as alternative means to address staffing shortages, be released to ensure a fully informed debate. Many students and faculty are also asking Manfredi to specifically address the academic virtues of the proposed hubbing of academic support staff.</p>
<p>Manfredi has the responsibility to be transparent and responsive. Until this information is shared, we will continue to see the PPP as being forced upon our departments, and any consultation measures as woefully insufficient.</p>
<p>Further, we encourage all students, faculty and staff to get informed. Visit our website and ask questions of the Dean at the AUS town hall on January 22 at 5:30 p.m. in Leacock 219. All students, staff, and faculty are welcome to attend. The Dean and Associate Deans will be present.</p>

<p>Hobson said the decision was made late on Monday night in light of some personal health issues that she is facing.</p>
<p>“I unfortunately am facing some personal health concerns, and we think it would be irresponsible to continue running in an election when I’m not sure what the future is going to look like for me,” Hobson, who is a former Orientation Coordinator, said. “It would also be ironic, and possibly hypocritical, to run on a platform of student support and wellness if I wasn’t well myself.”</p>
<p>“Although it was a really difficult decision for us and our core campaign team, we decided that the best thing for everyone was to no longer run.”</p>
<p>The slate was originally announced with Kilgour running for president, before the team decided to switch roles and have Hobson run instead. Kilgour, former Orientation staff, would have been running for vice-president external.</p>
<p>“I think to do any of these positions you need to be versatile. My interest lied in the external portfolio, and I found that out in the hunt for an external vice-president,” Kilgour said.</p>
<p>However, he has no plans to run in another capacity.</p>
<p>“Running without Kelly is not something I can see myself doing. Kelly and I have been in this together from day one,” Kilgour said. “We’ve made so much progress in the last week and having to redo it all is just not realistic if we want to run a justified campaign.”</p>
<p>“I’m still working through a lot of this in my mind — it’s all come together very quickly,” he said. “I have some plans for my time after Western that I’m very excited about so I will be weighing all my options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perkins, currently a Social Science councillor, also said she is not looking to run in another slate.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t really crossed my mind, just because I’ve been in the mindset of vice-president internal,” Perkins said. ”I’m definitely going to stay connected with what happens in the elections, and that’s specifically because of how much we all care about students.”</p>
<p>All members of the slate said the decision was a difficult one, and thanked their volunteers for all the support they had given.</p>
<p>“Without the support of our volunteers, running this campaign wouldn’t even be an option. My sincerest thanks go out to every single person who supported us and all the hard work they did to get us to where we were,” Hobson said.</p>
<p>“Letting them know that this wouldn’t continue was almost as hard as deciding to no longer run.”</p>
<p>The slate&#8217;s withdrawal leaves two slates in the running, with the campaign set to start a week today. Brian Belman and Mat Helfand are the two remaining presidential candidates.</p>

<p>UBC released the initial results of its <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/sports-criteria-237/">sports targeting review</a> today. Men’s football, rugby and soccer; women’s field hockey, ice hockey and volleyball; as well as both men’s and women’s basketball, cross-country, rowing, swimming and track and field will all remain varsity teams. </p>
<p>Notably absent from the list are women’s soccer, men’s hockey and men&#8217;s volleyball.</p>
<p>Managing director of athletics Ashley Howard said at a press conference that the remaining 13 varsity teams and five AMS sports clubs will now have to submit a plan outlining how they will better meet the review <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/varsity-criteria-180/">criteria</a> in the future if they want to be considered for varsity status.  </p>
<p>This second stage of the review will end in late February. </p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.athletics.ubc.ca/sport-review/">press release</a>, “a number of other teams are expected to be added&#8221; at the end of this stage.</p>
<p>UBC also announced $500,000 in additional funding to varsity sports, for a total increase of $800,000 beginning in April 2014.</p>
<p>The university maintains that this review is necessary to improve the quality of UBC varsity sports, and that in order to make this happen, some teams will likely lose varsity status even if all 29 current teams met the criteria. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve decided alongside our strategy for sustainability is one for excellence,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;So there is a budget factor there, and at some point we do draw the line and say we cannot go further if we want to maintain our conditions for excellence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final number of teams that will receive varsity status was not announced, but VP Students Louise Cowin cited sports reviews at other universities which resulted in the number of teams with varsity status being cut to &#8220;a number in the mid-teens.&#8221; </p>
<p>Howard said today&#8217;s decision was not based on maintaining an equal number of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s teams. </p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t necessary in the end. The teams that were put forward were put forward based on the discussion the assessment team had and their grading of them against the criteria,&#8221; Howard said.  </p>
<p>Cowin and Howard both said the decision also had nothing to do with alumni threatening to pull future funding from UBC due to the review.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were aware that this was not a process to make friends quickly,&#8221; Cowin said. &#8220;There is still tremendous support among alumni.&#8221; Howard said these alumni are choosing not to be vocal in the media. </p>
<p>No decisions have been made yet on which conferences the confirmed teams will compete in or whether or not teams that receive &#8220;competitive club&#8221; status will be able to use the Thunderbird brand.</p>

Attendees included varsity fencers, local club fencers, as well as a few special guests.</span></p>
<p>Fencing masters Rob Handelman and Connie Louie travelled from San Francisco for their first international clinic, and luckily for Western’s varsity fencing team, this camp comes just before the Ontario University Athletics championships in two weeks’ time.</p>
<p>“I really think it is an honour, a privilege to be asked to come,” Louie said.</p>
<p>She was not the only party happy with the arrangement.</p>
<p>“It’s been a great experience. We’ve really enjoyed having Rob and Connie here,” Brad Winder, Mustangs’ head coach, said. “They’ve passed on so much information. They’ve worked the fencers really, really hard, which is great. The fencers, our fencers, have really been good hosts to the visiting club fencers from the others areas.”</p>
<p>Handelman and Louie are well established in the fencing community. The husband and wife fencing duo have written two books on the discipline.</p>
<p>“We wrote a book on training young athletes, and it’s the only book that exists that’s actually a guidebook for sport medicine, fitness, technique, sports psychology, and so on, for training young athletes,” Handelman explained.</p>
<p>“And [Western fencing] read our book, and after reading our book, they started coming to some of the clinics that we ran in San Francisco [...] and so then they finally were able to invite us here to do a training camp with them,” he continued.</p>
<p>The masters reflected on the benefits of combining both a coaching clinic, in which masters teach effective pedagogical techniques with the three competitive fencing weapons — the foil, the sabre and the épée — as well as a training camp, meant for the fencers themselves.</p>
<p>“Oftentimes, generally, it’s just the coaches,” Louie said. “But the fact that there’s both, it makes it convenient for the coaches to practice now because there’s so many students in all three weapons so they can actually practice what they’ve learned. So it’s actually a good combination.”</p>
<p>Winder saw the merit in the new coupling as well.</p>
<p>“Here we’ve got fencers of all kinds — first years, second years, third years, some really good ones, some youth fencers, so it gives [the coaches] a chance to try a lot of different drills and their coaching techniques on fencers right away, and they get immediate feedback from not only Rob and Connie, but the fencers themselves,” Winder said.</p>
<p>The two-day intensive camp, in which the fencers focused on perfecting footwork and drills, comes just before the varsity team travels to Detroit for a tournament this weekend, followed by the OUA championships.</p>
<p>“We feel [the team’s] technique is really improving,” Winder said. “And now next weekend they’ll have a chance to practice it, and then I think we’re going to peak at the right time.”</p>

<p><strong>To The Editor:</strong></p>
<p>Campus Recreation and Student Health Services’ (SHS) new student program, Healthy Body Healthy Mind, which teaches students “stress management skills,” is a step in the right direction – but it’s not enough.</p>
<p>As a fourth-year student, I suffer from minor bouts of depression and anxiety due to school related stress. While I had positive experience at SHS during preliminary evaluations, SHS fell short when I needed follow up help.</p>
<p>I found out there is a three-month waiting list for a counsellor on campus. This forced me to look off campus for therapy. Fortunately, I am covered by my family’s healthcare plan or else I would be paying $150 out of pocket since OHIP does not cover mental health.</p>
<p>Mental health is as important as physical health. It should be a priority within the structure of the SHS by meeting the demands for mental counseling.<b></b></p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>As a Western student, it is reassuring to see my student leaders taking accountability for their actions, as was reported in <em>The Gazette</em>’s story regarding Team Whalen.</p>
<p>A hallmark of good leadership is recognizing one’s own strengths and weaknesses, which is exactly what Team Whalen has done with their self-evaluation. I applaud the USC executive for the transparency on their progress, and it is commendable that they have made it a priority to have that information accessible to the students they represent.</p>
<p>The annual rollover of positions makes it difficult for the USC to create change. However, Team Whalen’s commitment to accomplishing the platform points on which they were elected and their effort to plan for their successors makes me hopeful for some much-needed continuity in the USC. As elections approach, I hope Western will elect leaders who  like Team Whalen — are serious —about their platforms and not just their campaign videos.</p>

<p>Board of Governors candidates Ilana Shecter, Spencer Keys, Chris Roach and Nina Karimi focused on tuition, safety on campus and how they would handle themselves on the Board at Monday night&#8217;s debate.</p>
<p>Keys, a previous AMS president, said his experience in lobbying would make him a successful BoG rep.</p>
<p>“In essence, the role is being a lobbyist, and lobbying isn’t easy, but it’s not rocket science,” said Keys.</p>
<p>Roach focused on his experience in student government, including past work he’s done with Board members, which he said would allow him to immediately become an effective student representative, rather than taking the first few meetings to learn how the Board works.</p>
<p>“I won’t have to sacrifice two or three meetings, 20 to 30 percent of my potential time, to start working on student-driven issues,” said Roach.</p>
<p>Karimi said her experience in residence life gave her a perspective none of the other candidates have, and that she would push for student representation on Acadia Park planning.</p>
<p>“I think that knowledge is power and if you come with that, it starts to fade away that you’re a student,” said Karimi.</p>
<p>Shecter&#8217;s main platform points are supporting UBC&#8217;s divestment from fossil fuels and creating a safer campus by collaborating with AMS resource groups and other students.</p>
<p>“One of the main concerns I have as a student &#8230; are whose voices are being silenced,” said Shecter.</p>
<p>While all of the candidates agreed the BoG reps have to be an effective voice for students, some of the candidates had different ideas of what that meant.</p>
<p>“I think that we really have to think about the ways that we frame our problems,&#8221; said Schecter. &#8220;The truth of the matter is that we’re living in a climate emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This is not a place to be a loudmouth and be this radical. If you want to get change done, it has to happen &#8230; really constructively,&#8221; said Karimi.</p>
<p>Karimi said she would advocate for what students want on the Board, including lower tuition. She condemned past BoG reps for voting in favour of tuition increases, saying she would either vote no or abstain on a vote to increase tuition.</p>
<p>Keys said affordable housing and tuition would be his top two issues to focus on. He said how students present information to the Board is the key bringing about change.</p>
<p>“If you say it’s about affordability or accessibility, BoG reps are going to ignore you,&#8221; said Keys. &#8220;If you say &#8230; it is about maintaining the accountability of the university &#8230; then you start to actually have a different conversation.&#8221; </p>
<p>Shecter said creating safer spaces on campus would be the most important thing to work on. She said the university needs to consult with the AMS resource groups and take a more holistic approach to campus safety, rather than focusing on lighting and design-based solutions.</p>

<p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p>
<p>The Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations’ research awareness campaign claims to represent Western at large, but neglects the financial strain other faculties have felt over the past few years.</p>
<p>In an effort to maximize university revenue, special attention has been given to Western’s research-based faculties. To supplement decreasing government aid, President Chakma funnels money into sciences while financially choking faculties like Social Science, Arts and Humanities, and FIMS. What OCUFA describes as a “partnership” within the university has only divided our school.</p>
<p>While the research awareness campaign seeks to “rebalance government priorities,” Western itself must re-evaluate its priorities as an educational institution: financial gain or the open exchange of knowledge? Non-research faculties must not be forgotten in the quest to make a profit.<b></b></p>

This game-streaming service will be able to play games released for Sony systems up to the PS3 on smartphones, tablets, game consoles, and certain TV sets. Only a controller — not a console — will be required to use the service.</span></p>
<p>Similar to Valve’s recently announced Steam Machines, PlayStation Now offers the first ever-streaming game service on consoles and is powered by Sony’s exclusive advanced cloud-based technology. The service will also allow users to stream a selection of PS1 and PS2 games to both the PS3 and PS4, both of which will be the devices the service starts with.</p>
<p>The service will run at 720p and users will still be able to earn trophies as they would on current Sony gaming devices. Sony has confirmed that subscriptions will be similar to that of streaming giant Netflix. Overall performance of the service will depend on your own bandwidth limitations, although Sony has said you’ll need at least a 5Mbps Internet connection in order to get a “good experience” with the service.</p>
<p>It’s possible that this announcement is Sony’s answer to the PlayStation 4’s lack of backwards compatibility and also a way to get video games into the households of people that don’t purchase consoles.</p>
<p>A company as savvy and formidable as Sony clearly wouldn’t be launching the service if they didn’t truly believe they were onto something. The service will enter closed beta by the end of January and an official launch is slated for the summer months of 2014. No price point has yet been revealed.</p>

<p>“A selfie is a staged photograph of the self taken by the individual using any digital device for the purpose of distribution online,” says Kane Faucher, a professor in the Faculty of Information and Media Studies at Western.</p>
<p>The definition seems simple. That said, Faucher reveals that there is more meaning behind why the selfie is so ingrained in society&#8217;s online habits, and why it has become such a popular trend.</p>
<p>“Selfies can be understood according to different types or purposes, such as using what is called hexis — a term by Bourdieu — whereby the habitus of life is inscribed and embodied, usually in the form of taking a selfie in a uniform to denote one’s job, or a selfie in front of a landmark like the Eiffel Tower, to communicate to an audience that ‘I, so-and-so, am in Paris, and here is me in front of a symbol as proof of that event,” says Faucher.</p>
<p>Selfies have become the perfect pastime, indicating a new frontier in the evolution in social media.</p>
<p>“Depending on whether the selfie is constructed for the purpose of winning approbation, or status, we can call it a conspicuous practice,” says Faucher.</p>
<p>Is the selfie really something that new? While the self-portrait might appear as a norm from decades ago, it is a timeless pleasure many have taken part in. Even if you’re not taking them, you’re probably looking at them while lurking through our social networking sites.</p>
<p>“If I had to say what the earliest selfie was, think of someone like Rembrandt, who painted quite a few self-portraits,” Faucher says. “Today, the self-portrait can be done quickly through digital mediation.”</p>
<p>Selfies also allow people to be in control of producing their online image, and raise all sorts of questions about vanity, narcissism, and obsession with self-discovery.</p>
<p>“When used for status purposes, it is certainly more narcissistic,” says Faucher. “I would say that the very nature of the selfie, as linked to vanity, is the opposite of self-exploration as discovery, for unlike Lacanian mirror stage, one does not gain any new knowledge about one’s subjectivity,” he says.</p>
<p>It is human nature to want to show off proud achievements. When feeling good about yourself, and looking good, it has become an easy task to reach for cell phones and document it all through a selfie.</p>
<p>“If it says anything, it is most likely of a broader significance, such as a desperate need to prove existence in a digital milieu,” Faucher says.</p>

With the release of their second album in May</span><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">, </i><em>Nation II Nation</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, the electronic group has toured nonstop across North America, plus two trips to Europe, only relaxing for the holidays before they hit the studio to record. DJ Bear Witness looks back on 2013 as a year of growth and inspiration to carry on what began as a club night in Ottawa.</span></p>
<p>“It definitely was a fun experience,” Bear says. “We saw a lot of changes over the past year in the types of shows we were playing. The shows got bigger and bigger — a lot of club gigs as well — but we’ve definitely played to some of our largest over this past tour.</p>
<p>I think the best part was watching our show change and watching our show get tighter and tighter over the last 10 months.”</p>
<p>In 2007, DJ Bear Witness, alongside DJ NDN, saw an opportunity in their hometown of Ottawa to marry the traditional aboriginal social gathering — the pow wow — with an urban social gathering — the club.</p>
<p>“It was really just this simple idea to throw a party directed toward the aboriginal community in Ottawa as well to showcase ourselves as aborginal DJs in the city. It was a huge success right from our first show — it sold out,” Bear explains.</p>
<p>The premise was to sample traditional aboriginal drumming and music with electronic sounds to create a fusion that represents aboriginal music in an urban setting. When DJ Shub joined in on the party in 2009, he inspired Bear and NDN to start creating their own beats and music, rather than strictly sampling. An already established Canadian producer, Shub saw what NDN and Bear had going was unique and important to their culture and to the Canadian electronic music scene.</p>
<p>As a result, A Tribe Called Red has achieved rapid success in the EDM scene, and the group is still surprised by their reception not only from aboriginal communities, but electronic music fans as well.</p>
<p>“Our main goal, our number one thing was to create really great club music, and the thrill of a really great party. That was our initial intention. To know that we can have this success on the level of representing our community, and having an opportunity to talk about indigenous issues and then also have the success of just being electronic artists. That has been equally as awesome,” Bear says.</p>
<p>Not only does the trio make excellent dance music, but they also have an incredibly unique performance that inspires on two levels — the retrieval of control of the aboriginal image in the media, and being a representation for indigenous peoples in an urban setting.</p>
<p>“We throw a really great party. It’s not your average DJ show — it’s not one guy up there on turntables playing tracks,” Bear says. “We’re all up there, we play together, we interact with each other, with the audience, it’s a real show in the more traditional ‘band’ sense of a concert. There’s also a chance to learn something as well. We’re up there representing our culture in a very up front and unapologetic way.”</p>
<p>“If you want to experience something different as far as a concert experience or an EDM show, we’re definitely bringing something that you’re not gonna get from any other performance.”</p>
<p><em>A Tribe Called Red will be playing February 6 at Hideaway Records and Bar (545 Richmond St.) The show starts at 10:00 p.m. at tickets are $10.</em></p>

<p>Tanner Bokor, Harsev Oshan, Jackson Chen and joke candidate Winnie Code faced off tonight at the first presidential candidates debate of the 2014 elections. </p>
<p>Aside from Code, all candidates agreed on their support for a Broadway line to UBC, the betterment of campus culture and that communication between the AMS and students needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Oshan’s platform also includes working on the introduction of Vantage College to ensure that international students do not fall through the cracks financially. </p>
<p>In Chen&#8217;s opening statement, he said he would support the U-Pass, and suggested that the AMS move Block Party to a nightclub. &#8220;The costs are almost the same,&#8221; said Chen.</p>
<p>Bokor emphasized increased transparency of the AMS in his platform. </p>
<p>Candidates were first asked what they thought was the single most important issue facing the president&#8217;s office in the upcoming year, and what concrete actions they would take towards this. </p>
<p>Oshan said that to improve student culture on campus, the AMS needs to reach out to student groups like the UBC Party Calendar.  </p>
<p>“The problem with AMS communications is it’s a top-down approach — come talk to us if you have a problem,” Oshan said. “The AMS needs to start being that enabling force behind student action.”  </p>
<p>Bokor pointed out the disconnect between the AMS and many student groups. “As the AMS has grown, so has campus, and we have groups no longer integrated with us,” he said, citing Student Housing and Hospitality, the Inter-Fraternity Council and UBC Athletics as examples. To fix this, Bokor proposed creating a student assembly where groups could discuss issues and resources. </p>
<p>Code said the most important issue is the deficit, which is a predicted $800,000, and that the AMS should save money by cutting funding for all clubs and construction. </p>
<p>&#8220;So far the New SUB looks very good — it&#8217;s very mod, it&#8217;s very contemporary, you don&#8217;t need walls.&#8221; </p>
<p>The second question was what candidates thought was the most important relationship they would build or strengthen.</p>
<p>Bokor said the AMS needs to take a “holistic approach” and engage with as many people as possible through positive relationships with the media and government, as well as the university. </p>
<p>Chen said he would focus on the AMS&#8217;s relationships with clubs. He said he felt this relationship was lacking in his past role as a VP for the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.</p>
<p>“Club leaders don’t even know we can reach out to the AMS &#8230; [but] the AMS should be like a beggar: I want your help, I want you to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>An audience member asked how candidates plan to get the AMS to reach out more to students.</p>
<p>Oshan said that with the opening of the New SUB next year, “students would automatically want to know more about the AMS is because they would feel a sense of ownership.” </p>
<p>Chen agreed, saying that if he himself wasn’t running he would vote for Oshan.</p>
<p>Bokor said he wanted to improve the process for students looking to get involved in the AMS. He said most people start by joining AMS committees, but these have few spots and are poorly advertised. He said he would advertise meetings and committee structures, offer more training and professional development training for clubs and make VP offices more accessible to students. </p>
<p>Code said UBC should start hosting wine gardens, because they are cheaper than beer gardens.</p>
<p>Finally, current AMS president Caroline Wong asked where the candidates would begin making cuts if the fee restructuring referendum isn’t passed, leaving the AMS facing a $800,000 deficit. </p>
<p>Oshan and Chen could not say where they would start cutting. Chen said the AMS should use revenues from student housing to solve the university’s deficit. The AMS does not operate student housing.</p>
<p>Code had many ideas of where to make cuts: <em>The Ubyssey</em>, CiTR, Sprouts, furniture, Safewalk, and AMS archivist Sheldon Goldfarb’s $23 printing budget. </p>
<p>Bokor said he would look into scaling down or canceling events like Block Party or FarmAde.</p>
<p>The presidential candidates will debate again at the Great Debate on Monday, Jan. 27 from 5-7:30 p.m. at Hillel House. </p>

<p>The federal government recently announced the International Education Strategy, which aims to increase international involvement in higher education by increasing the number of international students and researchers in Canada.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Ontario is working with our postsecondary institutions to make Ontario a global destination of choice for postsecondary education,” said Tanya Blazina, spokesperson for the ministry.</p>
<p>The goals of the announced strategy include increasing the number of international students in Canada to 450,000 by 2022. The current international student population countrywide stands at 265,000 as of 2012.</p>
<p>“Our role is to ensure that the bar is set high for postsecondary education in Ontario through the implementation of a policy framework that protects our shared, earned global reputation for quality programs, student protection and a positive student experience,” Blazina said.</p>
<p>Western has met its current goal of having an international student body of 10 per cent, and now looks forward to increasing it to 15 per cent by 2018, according to Carolyn Ford, manager of international undergraduate recruitment at Western.</p>
<p>“We are looking internally, what’s the optimal size for Western’s facilities, staff, faculty, students and so that’s based on our analysis of what’s the right size for us,” Ford said. “We determined that the right size for us at undergraduate level is 4,900 students.”</p>
<p>Western’s current population of over 35,000 students includes 2,600 international students from over 100 countries.</p>
<p>“When we say that international students are going to go up to 15 per cent of the first-year class, this number is a conscious decision on our part to be able to serve our domestic Canadian community and at the same time have capacity to welcome international students from 117 different countries onto our campus,” Ford said.</p>
<p>According to Blazina, each international student contributes over $33,000 to the Ontario economy. This meant that international students contributed $2.2-billion to Ontario for the 2013-2014 fiscal year.</p>
<p>“With approximately 66,500 international students enrolled in Ontario postsecondary education institutions in 2013-14, we are pleased that Ontario has exceeded the government’s commitment,” Blazina said.</p>
<p>According to the education strategy, the government seeks to double the number of international students by 2022, without displacing local students.</p>
<p>“The province of Ontario has experienced unprecedented growth in the past and we believe we’ll be able to accommodate growth in the future, without impacting our local students,” Blazina said.</p>
<p>Ford said internationalization was a tough task that would require a lot of effort.</p>
<p>“Internationalization is not easy — it is a challenging, complex task and it calls upon each and every one of us,” Ford said. “But the end result of having gone through that process where you have a deeper sense of appreciation of the perspective of others is going to make you a global ready graduate, who makes a contributions to the community and organization you’re working in world wide.”</p>

<p>“It has been a difficult week for the Huron community and especially for the friends and family of Francis Fondoh. Francis touched so many of our lives and had wide-spread connections across both the Huron and Western campus,” wrote Huron Principal Dr. Stephen McClatchie in an open letter to campus.</p>
<p>The service will be led by Huron’s Chaplain Father Bill Cliff and will take place at 2:00 p.m. at Huron’s Chapel. Prior to the memorial service, there will be a visitation that will take place in the chapel from 11:00 a.m.–1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>An overflow room with a video feed will be set up next door in the Great Hall during the service. A reception in the Great Hall will follow the chapel service.</p>
<p>“I will be reading a passage of Scripture at the memorial service,” McClatchie said in an e-mail. “[The memorial service] will include family and friends speaking about Francis.”</p>
<p>An online appeal has been started by Fondoh’s sister, Sharon, to raise money for the expensive repatriation process to transport his body back to his home country of Cameroon for the funeral.</p>
<p>“The fundraiser was started because we need to raise some funds for the repatriation of my brother and also his burial in Cameroon,” said Sharon Fondoh. “We are all students, and also he did not have life insurance because he was not expected to pass away so young. It is a lot of financial strain on us.”</p>
<p>“The goal is $15,000, but if more than $15,000 is raised then it will help us a lot. We will need more than this amount for his funeral in Cameroon. We need all the help we can get,” Fondoh said.</p>
<p>The funeral is expected to take place on February 15 in Cameroon.</p>
<p>“Francis Fondoh was a very loved and loving brother, son, grandson and friend,” his sister said on the fundraiser page.</p>
<p>If you would like to donate, Sharon Fondoh’s online appeal can be found at <em>gofundme.com</em> under the title “Help Raise Money For Francis Fondoh.”</p>

<p>Students struggling with program equivalencies can now visit <em>ONTransfer.ca</em> to learn how their courses are recognized under the standards of other Ontario universities and colleges.</p>
<p>This project complements the recent establishment of the Ontario Council on Articulation and Transfer, an organization dedicated to aiding the transfer of credits across Ontario institutions.</p>
<p>Using this application, students can bypass the straining research process involved in transferring schools. With this simplified approach, students will hopefully avoid unnecessarily repeating courses, allowing them to finish their degree sooner.</p>
<p>“The new Course-to-Course Transfer Guide highlights the commitment of colleges and universities to create positive change,” said Dominic Giroux, co-chair of ONCAT’s board of directors, in a press release.</p>
<p>“As a sector, we are developing a truly comprehensive credit transfer system in Ontario, one that will provide maximum benefit to students.”</p>
<p>With about 21,500 students transferring within Ontario universities and colleges each year, this course-to-course database aims to reduce costs for students, the government, taxpayers and institutions. For example, using this method, the Ontario government predicts that transferring business majors can expect to save an average of $11,000 in tuition.</p>
<p>“It honestly is a win-win-win-win,” said Amir Eftekarpour, University Students’ Council vice-president external and Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance president.</p>
<p>Eftekarpour said OUSA played an active role in Ontario’s facilitation of course transferring, participating in round-tables on credit transfer, and making recommendations to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities on the implementation of the database as a part of the ONCAT student advisory board.</p>
<p>While Eftekarpour admits that credit transfer is inherently difficult due to the differences between unique programs and faculties, such as Western’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies, he has been an advocate for overcoming the “perceived prestige differences between universities.”</p>
<p>“There are a number of schools — the University of Toronto is an example of this — that have essentially stated that their courses and their students are more rigorous than certain institutions.”</p>
<p>A continuing goal for Eftekarpour and the government is to overcome these barriers in order for the majority of first- and second-year courses to be directly transferable between schools.</p>
<p><em>ONTransfer.ca</em> represents the government’s continued effort to facilitate the transferring of courses between post-secondary institutions. Other endeavours include increasing the pathways of credit transfer between colleges and universities from 300 to over 600, and establishing ONCAT.</p>

<p>A London Police Service investigation is ongoing, and the LPS told <em>The Gazette</em> more information on the incident will be available in the coming days.</p>
<p>John Carson, director of the Campus Community Police Service, elaborated on the theft.</p>
<p>“Our officers were the first to arrive, and they met with the staff person, and it was then that we had an initial report,” he confirmed. “All we do know is that one of the staff that’s working for hospitality in the Starbucks store was closing for the evening, putting the cash away — securing it for the evening, when she was accosted and the money was taken away from her.”</p>
<p>Both suspects had fled the scene prior to police arrival. Carson pointed out that because money was taken and a staff member was assaulted, it is classified as a robbery and the London Police were therefore called in. When contacted by <em>The Gazette</em>, employees at the Starbucks declined to comment.</p>
<p>Keith Marnoch, director of communications at Western, confirmed that operations resumed the following day despite the scare.</p>
<p>“That location and locations in the basement are back to normal operations and they were Friday morning […] and it is being dealt with directly with the person involved to make sure that all is well,” he said.</p>
<p>Carson ensured that following the LPS investigation, Campus Police would look at the findings and use them to work with hospitality to see if there is any room for improvement.</p>
<p>“Of course we always look at what practices are in place so we can work with hospitality to ensure that if there is anything we can do to improve, any deterrent for those kind of things, that we addressed them to the best of our ability,” he said. “Anytime staff are handling cash, you always have to be mindful of who’s around in the area and to make sure they’re cognizant of the environment that they’re in.”</p>

<p>Both VP external candidates were no-shows at the first debate of the 2014 AMS election campaign.</p>
<p>The position has two candidates this year — Bahareh Jokar, the current associate VP external, and Jon Snow (real name Philip He), who is running as a joke candidate — but neither was present at the start of Monday night&#8217;s debate at Brock Hall.</p>
<p>Both candidates arrived at Brock Hall past the designated time slot for their debate.</p>
<p>Jokar said she had confused the start time of tonight&#8217;s debates with tomorrow&#8217;s debate at Vanier residence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately I accidentally saved tomorrow&#8217;s time into my phone,&#8221; said Jokar. &#8220;I was operating under the impression that these debates started at 5:15 versus five o&#8217;clock, so by the time I got there, my time slot had already passed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jokar said she asked the elections committee if she could participate after the Board of Governors debate that was underway, but was told that she would have to wait until the very end of the evening&#8217;s debate schedule, which would have interfered with her commitments as a residence advisor in Ponderosa Commons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately because of my little mishap it just didn&#8217;t work out for me to participate in the debate this evening,&#8221; said Jokar.</p>
<p>Snow also arrived late for the debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earlier today I was in the office section of the SUB, and it just so happened that&#8217;s when two infiltrators from SFU attacked. While I did manage to save all the execs from an assassination attempt, I burned my hand in the process. I was in the care of my maester for most of the day. My hand&#8217;s mostly okay now, but he told me I&#8217;m supposed to remain in observation,&#8221; said Snow. &#8220;But I snuck out &#8230; and here I am late for the debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The VP external is responsible for lobbying on behalf of UBC students. The role involves advocating on issues such as tuition, transit and childcare. They will also oversee the transition from the U-Pass to the Compass Card.</p>
<p>The next debate involving the VP external candidates is scheduled for Jan. 27 at 4 p.m. at Hillel House. Both Jokar and Snow said they plan to attend.</p>

<p>The opening night of the first production of <em>The Seagull</em> in 1896 was a famously massive failure. One of the actresses was so intimidated by the hostility of the audience that she lost her voice, and Anton Chekhov, the playwright, was so embarrassed that he left the audience and spent the last two acts behind the scenes.</p>
<p>By contrast, it&#8217;s clear that the cast and crew of Theatre at UBC&#8217;s production of the iconic play are excited to show the fruits of their work to audiences. MFA student Kathleen Duborg, who herself acted in <em>The Seagull</em> during her undergraduate years, wanted a production that would test her directorial skills. </p>
<p>&#8220;As an actor, I usually immerse myself deep in the story of my own character, but directing such a large ensemble, I had to balance between the large world of the overall picture and also the details of human nature that Chekhov writes so beautifully,&#8221; said Duborg. &#8220;So my idea was to bring these people together to define as a family, ensuring a balance between the individual emotions [and] what is driving the scene. You should be able to tell why the characters are doing what they’re doing, not sitting there questioning everything.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Seagull</em> is a slice-of-life dramatic comedy set in the 19th-century Russian countryside. Like many of us, the characters are dissatisfied with different aspects of their lives: some desire love, some desire success and some desire artistic genius — yet none of them seem to be able to attain happiness. </p>
<p>The performance relies upon an ensemble cast of diverse, fully developed characters. The importance of a tight-knit cast was key to Duborg; fortuitously, the cast of 13 BFA acting students have been working together for between two to three years. Natasha Zacher, a third-year BFA student who stars as Nina in the play, believes the closeness of the class has made their group dynamics stronger, both on and offstage.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the roles are really substantial — it’s definitely a family affair,&#8221; Zacher said. &#8220;The characters all treat each other like family, which is really interesting considering that our ensemble has spent so much time together over the years — we all really do know each other so well and it’s been really delightful to play on these relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Seagull</em> is a play that provokes reactions. A four-act comedy with dark undertones and melodrama, Duborg believes that anybody can find something within the work with which to relate. </p>
<p>&#8220;Chekhov hit on something that I think still stands 150 years on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He looked at the ridiculousness of human nature, which is something that we all can recognize. Up until this point, everything along these lines was kind of hidden, these little tendencies which we all have weren’t really talked about in theatre or in opera. He really noticed the willfulness of human temperament, and the little kindnesses, which aren’t particularly dramatic, but enable us to live our lives day to day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The particular realism of the text proved compelling for Zacher. &#8220;The rehearsal process was very exploratory for this particular play. Kathy had a vision of what she wanted to achieve from us, but we also got to make a lot of decisions for our characters. There was lots of improvisation and physical work, which not only helped us develop our characters&#8217; stories, [but] made rehearsals a joy to come to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though the play is set in 1895, it feels immediate and real for the cast and crew. Sian Morris, a third-year BFA visual arts student, was in charge of designing and sourcing costumes. &#8220;There was so much research involved,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I looked into and learned a lot about Russian traditions, and went over into French fashion, which influenced my designs a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Seagull</em> will be Morris’s first show designing costumes, and she recognizes the importance of communicating the vision of the cast and crew. &#8220;We built a personality for each character, going back and forth with Kathy about her decisions and opinions. The director and cast were so helpful and this whole process really was a sharp learning curve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Design aside, Duborg always finds herself returning to the text. &#8220;The small things and passions are what make people live life. I think Chekhov saw this, as he was diagnosed with tuberculosis at a young age, so he recognized this thing about human beings. It’s all about love, which is fabulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why people come to the theatre,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;It invites them in, they feel really alive on the inside. We have a level of honesty from Chekhov which is very difficult to achieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>This weekend, the AMS elections committee posted that VP administration candidate Ava Nasiri had rejected several endorsements which she actually accepted.</p>
<p>The rejected endorsements went up Friday and were removed Sunday afternoon. </p>
<p>Elections administrator Roddy Lai said this was a result of a miscommunication. According to AMS policy, the elections committee must post candidates&#8217; acceptance or rejection of endorsements.</p>
<p>&#8220;She needed final confirmation from them and that&#8217;s why the miscommunication happened, because she informed us not to post these, and we thought she was rejecting them, which was not the case,&#8221; Lai said.</p>
<p>Lai was contacted by Nasiri and the posting was removed. He said once the AMS receives final confirmation, the endorsements will be reposted as accepted. </p>

<p>Current senate vice-chair Philip Edgcumbe has withdrawn from both the Board of Governors and Senate races in this year&#8217;s AMS elections.</p>
<p>Edgcumbe, a third-year MD/PhD student in biomedical engineering, said he withdrew from the races to focus on academics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m certainly not ruling out running again in the future, but once I sort of got into the process and starting thinking about it, I decided to withdraw,&#8221; said Edgcumbe.</p>
<p>The Board of Governors race is now down from six candidates to <a href="http://ubyssey.ca/news/wong-bog-87/">four</a>. </p>
<p>Along with Umang Khandelwal&#8217;s recent withdrawal from the senate race for academic reasons, 10 students are now competing for five student senate positions.</p>

The recent news of a temporary change in hospitalization practices for the homeless shines light on this woeful inadequacy, and the need for a structural change in the way that that homelessness is addressed.</p>
<p>Montreal’s mayor, Denis Coderre, campaigned on homelessness, and his suggestions for structural change in treating homelessness show promise. They would include an agency encompassing various levels of government, as well as businesses, community, and health organizations – and an increase in spending on the issue.</p>
<p>At the moment, many community organizations in the city address the immediate and long-term needs of the homeless. Included in this list – which is non-exhaustive and does not include facilities with confidential addresses – are various facilities located in or close to the downtown area. Typical services offered by shelters and day centres, some of the most vital resources available to the homeless, include access to some form of social services, hot meals, clean clothes, and access to showers. Additional resources offered are noted on a case-by-case basis.</p>

Initiatives to maintain and integrate research and teaching are seldom, and at times, limited. McGill’s Teaching Inquiry Network is one of the groups attempting to integrate research and teaching to benefit students’ undergraduate learning experience by bringing together professors to share and develop teaching methods. </p>
<p>The Network is a “cross-disciplinary faculty learning community of approximately 15 instructors” according to  Marcy Slapcoff, Educational Developer at Teaching and Learning Services (TLS). The group of staff members from the McGill Writing Centre, TLS, and the McGill Library meet on a monthly basis. Formed back in 2008, the group aims to create stronger links between teaching and research to enhance student learning. According to Slapcoff,  “The goal of the group from the beginning has been to understand how to best use coursework to  promote students’ understanding and active engagement with research.” </p>
<p>Almost all McGill Faculties are represented in the Network. Geography professor Sarah Turner is one of the members of the Teaching Inquiry Network. Last semester, Turner implemented some of these ideas from the Network in her GEOG 409: Geographies of Developing Asia course by having students write journal entries for each week of readings. “From the student feedback [journal entries] seem to work really well as a learning tool and students appreciate the ability to take time crafting their responses rather than taking an exam that they have to cram for.” </p>
<p>“Although it might seem weird,” continued Turner, “Professors don’t have that many opportunities to really debate and critique different teaching approaches, because we’re so busy just getting all the parts of our job done. So this is a fun and productive way to think through new ideas.” </p>
<p>A student in GEOG 409 (who wished to remain anonymous) attested to the overall positive experience. “The course was structured really well. [...] It was my first time having to write journal entries for a course. It actually forced [students] to think about what the author was saying and relate it to the class, and ourselves personally. I thought it was really good.”<br />
The Network has also received support from the University. In 2011, the Nework facilitated the Joint Board Senate meeting where the Board of Governors supported the Network’s idea that “enhancing students’ understanding of research is a powerful way to improve student learning and the overall undergraduate experience.” </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The goal of the group [...] has been to understand how to best use coursework to  promote students’ understanding and active engagement with research&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>McGill currently has a number of other services dedicated to promoting undergraduates’ involvement in research. Some of these groups include Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering, the Arts Undergraduate Research Internship Award, and the Office of Undergraduate Research in Science. Though these services benefit students, they are not without their limitations, as they are only open for a limited audience. Many of them are very Faculty-specific or only available to students who actually apply to volunteer. According to Slapcoff, this stands in contrast to the Teaching-Research Project, which has the goal of reaching every McGill undergraduate through their coursework.</p>
<p>Enhancing and discussing teaching methods is a step toward improving the undergraduate experience at  post-secondary institutions, where generally the main qualifier of a professor is their research rather than their teaching skills and methods. Turner maintained, “Hopefully students then feel they benefit from a wider and more dynamic range of teaching approaches and assessment strategies.”</p>

Homeless people in Montreal requiring treatment will now be transported to the nearest hospital.</p>
<p>Introduced in early January, the new system replaces the previous rotational program, wherein Montreal hospitals would alternate taking in homeless people on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>According to the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency, the objective of the change is to provide better care for the patients. “We noticed that the homeless tend to always stay in the same sector,” explained Geneviève Bettez, spokesperson of the agency, in French. “So with this change, there is a good chance that they will be directed to the same establishments more frequently.”</p>
<p>“We believe that healthcare professionals will develop a better knowledge of each homeless person and of their file, which will improve the treatment of the patients,” Bettez told The Daily.</p>
<p>The decision, while only temporary, was imposed on the hospitals because of the weather conditions. “With the coming of the cold weather, the measure has been implemented early. […] It’s only in place until February, and then we’ll reevaluate it with our partners,” added Bettez.</p>
<p>The measure has been criticized by hospital officials at the Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM). According to a<em> CBC</em> article from January 10, Paul Lespérance, the head of psychiatry at the CHUM, worries that the downtown Notre-Dame Hospital may become overcrowded. Lespérance noted that it will be admitting about 50 per cent of the patients.</p>
<p>The Old Brewery Mission, which provides emergency, transition, and housing services to the homeless population of Montreal, praised the move as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>“I think, generally speaking, it’s a good move to do what they did. […] I think it’s much better to be able to get services as nearby as possible, because we are dealing with people who are coping with a crisis,” said Matthew Pierce, Director General of the Mission.</p>
<p>Pierce recognized that the concerns of overcrowding at the CHUM are valid. “I don’t think it’s going to be a massive influx of people, but I think if I were at the downtown hospital, I would be concerned,” he said.</p>
<p>The difficulties faced by homeless people in obtaining effective treatment are not limited to transportation. According to Pierce, homelessness carries a social stigma which impedes access to medical care.</p>
<p>“People are not comfortable with homeless people. When they’re in an emergency room in the hospital, they often don’t get the same treatment as other patients. They’re often treated very cursorily, very quickly, and not given the same kind of attention,” said Pierce.</p>
<p>“Often […] the homeless person is seen quickly, they’re given their prescription and pills […] they come to the front door of our shelter and sell [the pills] and then don’t go back next week. So it’s a complete waste of our dollars.”</p>
<p>Pierce pointed to the Old Brewery Mission’s current partnership with the CHUM for treating homeless people with mental health issues as an effective method of providing care. Under this pilot program, a psychiatrist, a psychiatric nurse, and a psychiatric social worker treat the patients at a ward allocated by the Mission.</p>
<p>“We have a partnership with the CHUM hospital system’s department of psychiatry, whereby homeless people with mental health disorders are dealt with inside our pavilions. […] We can make sure they live in a stable, peaceful and secure environment. We expect that the health outcomes, especially mental health outcomes, will be significantly accelerated, and we’re already seeing that, in fact.”</p>
<p>Pierce also highlighted the necessity of transitional measures to get homeless people out of shelter life. “The mission of the Old Brewery Mission is to end homelessness, not to manage homelessness,” he said. “We want to continue to evolve until we get it done.”</p>

<p>McGill’s announcement that the University will be overhauling the model of Hall Directors at McGill Residences has been met with resistance from the floor fellow community. Currently, each residence has a part-time Hall Director, but the new model will see approximately four full-time Hall Directors hired to oversee McGill’s nine residence halls.</p>
<p>According to documents obtained by The Daily, Janice Johnson, Managing Director, Residence Life and Customer Relations, and the residence staff behind this decision are looking to hire people with degrees in areas such as counselling or social work, and who have professional experience within the residence environment.</p>
<p>Due to its size, New Residence Hall (NRH) has had a full-time Hall Director since the 2012-13 academic year. A current floor fellow at NRH, Allen Scholl, told The Daily in an email, “I sincerely believe that the changes to be made in the new system of Hall Directors are being set in place to improve the job of the Hall Director.”</p>
<p>There will also be new part-time Faculty-Mentors-in-Rez positions in each hall, and according to Johnson, it would be a bonus if current Hall Directors took the position; however, the value of these positions is a point of contention.</p>
<p>“It’s a position created so that the [administration] can say ‘Here’s a job – they can take it if they want it. If they leave then it’s their choice,’” said a Carrefour Sherbrooke floor fellow who wished to remain anonymous to The Daily.</p>
<h3>Shock as pilot project becomes permanent</h3>
<p>This year, a pilot project saw one full-time Hall Director responsible for three residences: Royal Victoria College (RVC), Carrefour Sherbrooke, and Varcity515. However, floor fellows under this new pilot project told The Daily that the model was implemented permanently without any consultation.</p>
<p>According to the Carrefour Sherbrooke floor fellow, quoted above, who works under the project, floor fellows felt betrayed. “The head of residences announced that [the new model] is what they’re going to do for everyone next year, and we had never been asked how it was going or what it was like.”</p>
<p>These sentiments were echoed by Jessica Coon, current part-time Hall Director of Solin Hall. “I do not think there was much in the way of consultation process, and I know many of the floor fellows are upset about this,” Coon said in an email to The Daily.</p>
<h3>Questions over the sustainability of the current model</h3>
<p>In an interview with The Daily, Johnson stated that the idea of installing full-time Directors was common practice at other universities, and had been considered at McGill for a while.</p>
<p>Unlike many decisions made at McGill, the changes to the Hall Director model were not motivated by budget cuts. According to Johnson, the new model will cost around $32,000 more – even though it will cut down on the number of Directors – but that the budget was balanced with savings elsewhere.</p>
<p>Johnson pointed to difficulties with finding applicants for part-time positions as part of the reason behind the shift.</p>
<p>“I don’t think [the current model] is necessarily unsustainable exactly at this moment, but I think we’re at risk of being unsustainable,” said Johnson. “Before things reach a crisis point, or a Hall Director burns out, it seemed like a good idea to be proactive. Coming in as new leadership is a good time to make change.”</p>
<p>Floor fellows criticized the reasoning given by Johnson for the changes. “How does [the administration] know that current faculty members and Hall Directors can’t handle their positions? There’s this talk of impending crisis, which is such a scare tactic,” argued Erin Sobat, former president of Douglas Hall Residence Council.</p>
<p>In an informal floor fellow meeting on January 15, RVC floor fellow Sean Reginio argued that other options should have been considered before replacing the current Directors. “They addressed the issue of hiring Directors by changing the model, instead of changing the recruitment [process].”</p>
<h3>The importance of Hall Directors</h3>
<p>“During my time as a floor fellow I dealt with multiple severe crisis situations that required immediate help of a Director, sometimes in the middle of the night. These were literally life and death situations, and if my Director had not lived in the same building, I do not think the situations could have turned out as positively as they did,” said a former floor fellow of three years, who wished to remain anonymous, in an email to The Daily.</p>
<p>Floor fellows also expressed concern that the full-time Directors may be inclined to side with administration. “Whenever we complained about administration stuff this year, [the current Director] defended it to us&#8230; because it’s [the Director’s] full-time job, they’re now someone who mediates concern as opposed to someone who brings concerns from the bottom up,” the Carrefour floor fellow told The Daily.</p>
<p>According to Sobat, resistance from floor fellows was expected by administration. “Current Hall Directors were told in a staff meeting in November to deal with resistance from floor fellows, and basically asked to do damage control. They know it’s not going to be popular,” said Sobat.</p>
<p>At the January 15 meeting, a floor fellow – who wished to remain anonymous – said that the relationship between the Hall Director and the floor fellows requires open communication, and that it would be difficult to maintain that with 17 people.</p>
<p>Although some of the floor fellows expressed concern over a shift away from the harm reduction system currently in place – where non-judgemental support is encouraged – Johnson told The Daily that there was no interest in moving away from that model. “I will swear to anyone who wants me to swear – I do not intend to go down the road of writing tickets and busting people all the time.”</p>
<p>According to Johnson, a working group dedicated to deciding the specifics of the new Hall Director model will be calling for input from the McGill community in the next week. For many, this call for feedback is too little, too late.</p>
<p>“A big issue that I’ve had with this is how untransparent this entire process has been and how no floor fellow or Hall Director has been consulted in this decision,” said Courtney Ayukawa, a floor fellow at RVC. “I think that this [will set a precedent], so in the future, if residences want to make other changes as well, they feel less obligated to make things transparent or consultative.”</p>

<h3>A visit from the Provost</h3>
<p>Provost Anthony Masi – whose position encompasses roles as both chief academic officer and chief budget officer of the University – made a guest appearance, and took the opportunity to take questions from graduate students and outline McGill’s strategic vision for the next few years.</p>
<p>One question aimed to determine if McGill was going to take any action to improve the state of graduate student supervision.</p>
<p>“Supervision is the single most important issue on campus,” said Masi, indicating that the data from anonymous surveys of graduate students signals that improving the quality of graduate supervision is a standout issue.</p>
<p>The University has begun its campaign to improve supervision with a new webpage that states the roles and responsibilities of a supervising professor and provides resources on interaction with supervisees and “recognizing student diversity.”</p>
<p>“This list of skill sets will be later included in staff training days,” said Masi, adding that “most of the time, professors forget that they were once graduate students too.”</p>
<p>His presentation, meanwhile, centred on the University’s actions regarding recent budget cuts and allocations – cuts that have, among other outcomes, closed down libraries and resulted in incentivized retirement programs for staff.</p>
<p>Outlining the finances of the University, Masi said, “Over the last two years, we’ve added $30 million in deficit to our operating budget. But we have to pay that deficit back in five years, which means that we have to balance our books, and $5 million a year has to be used to pay back that deficit.”</p>
<p>Masi also outlined the mentality underlying budget cuts.</p>
<p>“You have to make a decision about allocations based on your academic priorities,” Masi said. “Those priorities come out of Achieving Strategic Academic Priorities (ASAP), the University’s academic white paper.”</p>
<p>Moving on to McGill’s financial situation, the Provost focused on choices about budget allocation.</p>
<p>“What we’re asking all of the units to do is not to try to replicate what they were doing before [the cuts] but to make conscious choices,” Masi said. “Do we have to do everything we’re doing? Can we do the things that we are doing differently? How can we be more efficient in the way we work?”</p>
<h3>Electoral Reform</h3>
<p>PGSS also finalized the remainder of the rewriting of some electoral rules. This was part of an effort to resolve contradictions between the society’s practices and their activities manual.</p>
<p>According to PGSS Secretary-General Jonathan Mooney, “We wanted everything to be crystal clear so as to make sure that no one was doubting our legitimacy – we don’t want to appear to be an illegitimate students’ society.”</p>
<p>PGSS’ Chief Returning Officer (CRO) Colby Briggs confirmed that, “The intent of these changes was, by and large, to bring the Society’s Activities Manual in line with practical application.”</p>
<p>He added that a mechanism was added for the CRO to enforce electoral regulations by penalizing rule-breaking candidates through “financial or time-based incentives” (in other words, fines or volunteer hours), instead of disqualifying them.</p>

A dream is just a remixed, jacked-up version of things we remember from real life. These trivial fragments may never have been consciously recorded, but seep into the unconscious. If everything in a dream is actually unoriginal and really a compilation of reality, then to what can we credit the unnerving realities within dreams? The curiosity of the mind or the intrigue of the world? Isabelle Guimond tackles this question in her oil-and-aerosol collection, “Rêve, Baby, Rêve,” (“Dream, Baby, Dream”) currently showing at the Galerie de l’UQAM.</p>
<p>Her artwork teeters between the real and the dreamlike. All her subjects seem very real, very morose, and very mundane. One painting shows a collection of ordinary, dirty trash, and another is an elegant depiction of a teenager jumping over a fence. Yet Guimond’s hazy outlines and the colourful palette push the audience into a dreamlike trance. By titling such sombre pieces “Dream, Baby, Dream,” Guimond exhibits a sense of dark irony. That, or extremely low standards. After all, how can anyone aspire to such ordinary circumstances?</p>
<p>In retrospect, the dreams of many sculpted society into what it is today. The dreams of many resulted in ‘such ordinary circumstances.’ Titles in the collection such as It Girl and Mascarade seem glamorous individually but are inconsistent with the art itself. The It Girl is pretty with blonde hair and sparkly blue eyes, but is jeering in front of rebellious posters that tell her, in French, “You weren’t there to take the photo.” Her demeanour strips the ‘it’ right out of the ‘girl.’ Society’s value for this superficial perfection has ignored the true imperfection. What we see on the outside really is ‘it.’ But this surface impression might just be the most dreamlike aspect of our reality. Similarly, the sultry, romantic idea of masquerade in Guimond’s Mascarade is ridiculed with a plastic bag. Like many unfortunate animals in nature, a girl is being suffocated by a discarded plastic bag. In the background, a limp, dead plant surrounds her, seeming to also threaten her. In a world that dreams of the beauty of consumerism, we often forget the consequences of our desires. But Guimond seems to warn us they will eventually come back to haunt us, like the objects in the painting.</p>
<p>The dreaminess of Guimond’s art could represent a desperate hope that our ordinary lives are really just a dream and that reality is actually something much more fantastical. All we need to do is wake up. Loosely inspired by Montreal’s Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood, a low-income area, Guimond’s collection faces the harshness of reality.</p>
<blockquote><p> “[You dream] deep dreams in the face of extreme situations, soft delinquencies to make yourself feel alive.” &#8211; Isabelle Guimond</p></blockquote>
<p>“[You dream] deep dreams in the face of extreme situations, soft delinquencies to make yourself feel alive,” said Guimond in French in an interview with The Daily.<br />
The artist explained that in difficult situations, a person’s dreams shine the brightest. Like the subjects of the collection, the extremities and absurdities of reality have forced people to see things in a different light, a more colourful light. To think outside the box is to dream of escaping the box. These dreams are the first steps toward improving these ‘ordinary circumstances,’ the hope of creating a better reality.</p>
<p>Behind Guimond’s dark humour lies a lighter, more hopeful message. She addresses the entrapment of reality with a cynical tone. Even if our reality were just a dream, we still couldn’t escape it; however, the exhibit bears a resemblance to the song from which it takes its name. Though known best through Bruce Springsteen’s bleak cover, the original version of “Dream, Baby, Dream,” by the band Suicide is more hopeful. Inspired by this, Guimond also repeatedly emphasizes the need to dream, and to dream better. If society dreams hard and well enough, then the nightmare of reality might finish.</p>

In the dream, it was a simple black band around my left wrist, painstakingly inked dot by dot by dot. Over the next few days I felt strangely compelled by the dream, eventually culminating in the purchase of a box of 50 tattoo needles and black tattoo ink, and a first few nervous pinpricks.</p>
<p>To me, my (now numerous) tattoos are strong bits of defiance embedded permanently and visibly on my body. The first time I took a tattoo needle to my skin, I felt incredibly empowered with the ability to change the course of my body’s future. “What if you regret it?” my mother probes with every new tattoo. “That’s awfully… visible,” says a friend when tattoos show up on my knuckles.</p>
<p>Any person with obvious tattoos is familiar with the judgemental questions disguised as gentle concern from family and friends. “Are you sure you want that forever?” or “Will you still like it when you’re older?” It takes a certain amount of learned confidence to shrug off the overbearing intrusions. For me to be the one responsible for both the pain and the resulting art carries an even greater sense of bodily autonomy. To reclaim my own skin in this way is as much a personal, political act as it is an aesthetic one.</p>
<p>The application of a layer of nail polish or makeup, or wearing one’s favourite clothes, carries the same weight for some, especially when these acts are out of the ordinary. A certain haircut can be as much about comfort as it is about defiance. Sometimes it’s not only relatives or friends – sometimes it feels like the whole world is sneering behind your back, and this is when something so small as drawing a stroke of eyeliner feels like the bravest thing in the world.</p>
<p>Doing what is right for your body often sounds like a straightforward rule out of a self-help book. Invasions of privacy dog trans* people who pursue surgical, hormonal, sartorial, or any other avenues to change their body’s appearance. As they fail to make the expected overnight switch from one socially condoned gender prescription to another, this becomes inevitable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>‘Transitioning’ is, in the first place, a bit of a misnomer. The term implies, whether directly or indirectly, that a trans* person is not their gender until they pass a sufficient number of societal ‘tests’ that proves them such. A trans woman is not ‘a man who became a woman,’ as people are wont to believe. She is a woman.</p>
<p>For years, I settled uncomfortably into identifying myself as a butch, straight woman. I have since come to understand that I am a non-binary person – neither male nor female – with fairly few restrictions on my sexuality. Yet I did not ‘become’ a non-binary person. I was always a non-binary person. After years of confusion and anxiety, I was finally able to recognize the feeling that weighed on me for much of my life, and understand the steps I could take to change it.</p>
<p>‘Just be yourself’ is a phrase with an ugly irony. When trans* people are ‘just being themselves,’ they risk ridicule, hate, prejudice, and violence.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy to defy the immense societal pressure to be cis and fall in line with whatever gender has been assigned to your body. It isn’t easy to come out to friends and family, who, for all you know, may turn against you with vitriol. It isn’t easy to ‘just be yourself’ when you are asked to prove that you deserve to occupy space, let alone earn a living wage, attend school, or go so far as to settle down and start a family.</p>
<p>Like the questions that follow every tattooed person, every trans* person is asked whether they have really thought things through. If they’re really sure this is what they want forever; if this surgery or that outfit or those friends are really right. Why anyone would decide to undergo my surgery and biweekly self-injected hormone regimen on a whim is frankly beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>And once the initial decision to ‘transition’ has been grudgingly accepted, the accusations of not trying ‘hard enough’ start to pour in. “If you’re really a woman, why are you wearing those pants?” “If you’re really a man, why would you wear nail polish?” The flip-flopping between “Why are you doing it?” and “Why aren’t you doing it enough?” is a perpetual double standard enacted at every stage of the so-called transition – not only by people in day-to-day life, but also by the gatekeepers of the institutional power that many must access in order to survive.</p>
<blockquote><p>It should be a default expectation that any person – trans* or not – is able to do whatever they please with the way they look without fearing danger from strangers on the street or lovers in the bedroom. But that is not the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The pervasive conception of ‘transition’ is that it’s an abrupt process by which a man ‘becomes’ a woman, or vice versa. This culminates as the supposed ‘sex change,’ in which a trans* person apparently goes under the knife and walks out with an all-new set of genitals and secondary sex characteristics. Nearly every trans* person has had someone ask if they’ve had “the surgery,” often uttered in a reverent and fearful whisper.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> In reality, ‘transitioning’ is a long, complex process of conforming one’s body or social image to fit their actual gender, and it differs for every trans* person. I know a significant number of trans* people who have not, and do not intend to, pursue hormone replacement therapy, and similarly the types of surgery that people need is variable.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The only way a trans* person can expect to feel safe around the average crowd of cis people is to appear to be a cis person, meaning that they appear to either be strictly male or female – whether that means being read as their birth gender, or blending in flawlessly as the ‘opposite’ gender binary through some combination of good genetic luck, hard work, time, and money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an ideal world, safety would not be one of the top concerns in a trans* person’s mind when they decide to pursue any avenues of making their bodies conform to their needs. It should be a default expectation that any person – trans* or not – is able to do whatever they please with the way they look without fearing danger from strangers on the street or lovers in the bedroom. But that is not the case.</p>
<p>Trans* people are often left balancing what makes them feel right and what makes other people uncomfortable. We try to organize ourselves and our behaviours around what makes us stop wanting to crawl out of our own skins, and what could get the shit beaten out of us. And in this world, as much as petitioning and speaking at workshops is important work, survival itself can be a form of activism. The search for a comfortable existence is its own form of resistance for people who are seen as ‘abnormal’ enough to have the worth of their lives be questioned by everyone, from peers to entire governments.</p>

<p>I am writing to express my disappointment in The McGill Daily for not running images of my artwork alongside an interview with me (“<a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/01/getting-graphic/">Getting graphic</a>,” Culture, January 9, page 17). I was informed this was due to the religious content of my work. I see this as a weak-willed editorial decision.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Louis Denizet’s thoughtful interview was undermined by this shameful outcome. Cowardly editorial choices are unfortunate in all arenas, but when they occur within the context of a learning institution (one of Canada’s most respected educational establishments, no less) it is particularly egregious.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The irony of your decision is of course glaring and comedic. The Daily chose not to run a potentially controversial image alongside an interview that discusses art, activism, opinion, personal expression, and public discourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I am curious who precisely you were hoping to protect by taking this course of action? Do you believe that the McGill community lacks the intellectual capacity to handle art containing religious imagery in the context of an article subtitled “Graphic designer Isaiah King on art and activism?”</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I feel that small individual acts of censorship are ultimately more corrosive than overt censorship from large organizations such as governments, corporations, or religious institutions. When a private citizen (especially an editor working in the news media) makes choices that are consciously contrary to expression, dialogue, and freedom of speech, that is when censorship has truly entered our day-to-day lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The punchline to this whole episode is that you thought it better to create your own artwork to appear alongside the article, rather than display art by the interviewee. By doing so, you have demonstrated a unique and bizarre logic and successfully run an interview with one artist while prominently featuring the work of another.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Yours truly in disappointment,</span></p>

Right now, most residences have one part-time Hall Director for every six or seven floor fellows. The current system will be modified so that the several part-time Hall Director positions will be consolidated into fewer full-time positions. As a result, each Director’s efforts will be spread over multiple residences.</p>
<p>Hall Directors act as Disciplinary Officers on behalf of the administration and facilitate floor fellows’ work. Student floor fellows do not have a strict mandate but tend to serve as role models, community builders, and as resources for student residents. With a highly demanding job, the new full-time Hall Directors’ mandate to manage several buildings means they will be less available to floor fellows and students.</p>
<p>The McGill residence system’s emphasis on harm reduction, an approach that focuses on non-judgemental support, makes it unique in Canada, and other universities across the country are striving to emulate it. Not only are the Hall Director positions becoming more demanding, but most are being filled by outside professionals. The overhaul threatens this harm reduction system, since outside professionals from traditional residence systems are unfamiliar with McGill’s unique system. To assume that a professional will better support the needs of students, rather than Directors who have been with McGill residences for many years, shows a lack of support for those living in residences.</p>
<p>McGill ran a pilot project with a full-time Director who was responsible for Carrefour Sherbrooke, Royal Victoria College, and Varcity515 residences last semester. The administration ended the pilot project without seeking feedback from students involved, but responses from floor fellows have been overwhelmingly negative. The administration claims that the current system is unsustainable but they back this with no concrete evidence. What’s more, no one from the administration decided to consult the Hall Directors, floor fellows, or any students before implementing this new system.</p>
<p>This lack of communication is another episode in McGill’s long history of disregarding the opinions of students and employees. This top-down decision-making process threatens the existing community-driven residence system and exemplifies the administration’s drive toward bureaucratization. In light of this lack of consultation and student support, McGill should reconsider implementing this new system and reprioritize feedback from Hall Directors and floor fellows – the individuals upon whom the residence system depends.</p>

The human brain has become the defining feature of our species, and recent advances in brain research have inspired neuroscientists and programmers alike to turn information about this mysterious and complex organ into biomimetic (‘life-imitating’) technologies.</p>
<p>One such technology was introduced in 2012, by scientists at the University of Waterloo. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/waterloo-researchers-create-worlds-largest-functioning-model" target="_blank">Spaun</a>, short for Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network, is the largest computer simulation of a functioning brain to date. It is the brainchild of Chris Eliasmith, a professor in philosophy and systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo, who developed the system as a proof-of-principle supplement to his recent book: <em>How to Build a Brain</em>.</p>
<p>The model is composed of 2.5 million simulated neurons and four different neurotransmitters that allow it to ‘think’ using the same kind of neural connections as the mammalian brain. Instead of code, Spaun receives visual inputs in the form of numbers and symbols, which it responds to by performing simple tasks with a simulated robotic arm. Tasks are similar to basic IQ test questions, which include pattern recognition and retracing visual input from memory.</p>
<p>“There are no connections in the model that aren’t in the brain,” explains Eliasmith. “Models like Spaun are not expressed using standard computational structures. In order to run on today’s computers, we have to translate the model into code; but it is more natural and efficient to run on specialized hardware that is structured more like a brain.”</p>
<p>Models like Spaun are unique from other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) because they are committed to solving problems in the same way as humans. Cognitive computer systems are at the other end of the spectrum and are capable of ‘machine learning,’ which allows them to analyze and recall patterns and trends from a large amount of data. These systems are undoubtedly clever, but their problem-solving strategies are incomparable to humans’.</p>
<p>For instance, IBM’s research team started developing a<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/ca/en/watson/science-behind_watson.shtml" target="_blank"> new cognitive computer in 2006</a>, a namesake of IBM’s former CEO, Thomas J. Watson, which became the first of its kind to replicate the language and analytical ability of humans. Watson made headlines around the world after it beat long-time Jeopardy champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter on the popular gameshow in 2011. However, the data-containing servers stored by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Computer-t.html?pagewanted=8&amp;_r=1" target="_blank">Watson</a> filled up an entire room above the set, and it was running over 100 algorithms per clue in order to find the most probable answer.</p>
<p>It has taken two years for the IBM team to shrink Watson from its original 16-terabyte mammoth state to the size of a pizza box, all while increasing its processing speed by 240 per cent; however, it is still a far cry from the efficiency of a human brain, which consumes less power than a light bulb and weighs an average of three pounds.</p>
<p>The advent of neuromorphic devices has brought us closer to this ideal. IBM’s SyNAPSE (Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics) project has recently developed prototypes of a silicon neurosynaptic chip that mimic the brain’s natural processing capacity using artificial ‘neurons’ connected to one another. The building block of these chips is a ‘corelet’ that represents a network of synapses for a specific function, which can be combined and programmed for more complex applications. The project’s ultimate goal is a human-scale cognitive computing system, on the order of 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses that would occupy the same volume as a brain.</p>
<p>These brain-like technologies could not be possible without the recent surge in discoveries about brain function at genetic, molecular, and behavioural levels. In part, these can be attributed to advances in genetics, stem cell biology, and imaging.</p>
<p>Several innovative tools have made an impact on research in brain circuitry, including genetically-engineered viruses that can trace infected neuron pathways to determine their connections in brain tissue, the<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17972876 " target="_blank"> Brainbow</a> technique (a genetic method to fluorescently label individual neurons) developed at Harvard Medical School in 2007, and the emergent field of optogenetics, which is used to artificially stimulate nerve cell activity. It can take up to twenty years for new research to be implemented into technology.</p>
<p>The creation of brain-machine interfaces is an excellent example this technology. Neuroengineering has already made such interfaces a reality, as with cochlear implants and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease, based on research into auditory function and disease pathology. One laboratory at the Montreal Neurological Institute is working on laying the scientific groundwork for using visual brain-machine interfaces to treat blindness. Christopher Pack, a professor in visual neurophysiology at McGill, studies the function of visual cortical circuits in the brain at a mathematical level. For the visual cortex, Pack envisions a small camera connected directly to the brain as a solution to retinal degeneration.</p>
<p>“There is still a long way to go in terms of developing the surgical approach, the technology that interfaces with the brain, and the algorithms that permit the camera to communicate with the brain,” Pack told The Daily. “Previous work has succeeded in allowing blind subjects to detect spots of light and perhaps crude shapes, but the longer term goal would be to restore the perception of detailed vision – things like faces, letters, motion, et cetera.”</p>
<p>Pack’s research is still in the early stages of translation into the tech sphere, but it is a clear indicator of the future of neuroscientific progress. We are hurtling toward the time when computers may surpass their creators in intelligence. The great mathematician John von Neumann defined this as ‘singularity.’ Shortly after Neumann’s death, an unfinished manuscript entitled “The Computer and the Brain” was published, outlining his thoughts on the computer as a brain-like processor. Even in the 1950s, the parallels were evident – and the conclusion startling. With the rate of technology accelerating the way it has in the last decade, it may well be time to start redefining what it means to be human.</p>

<p>On two occasions The Daily has published commentaries in support of a group called Support Our Staff at McGill (“<a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2013/11/save-our-support-staff/">Save our support staff</a>,” Commentary, November 25, page 17 and “<a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/01/get-informed-take-action/">Get informed, take action!</a>,” Commentary, January 13, page 8). The group is critical of the Faculty of Arts’ People, Processes, &amp; Partnerships (PPP) project to reorganize administrative and support services at the departmental level. Critical engagement and disagreement are fundamental characteristics of universities, but so too is an obligation not to distort the facts.</p>
<p>So what are the facts? The PPP project, launched in November 2012, is one of the most extensive projects ever undertaken by the Faculty. Almost 120 people in 12 different groups have met 177 times to consider every aspect of administrative and support service delivery to departments. From the beginning, students have been consulted and proactively approached to be members of various working groups. The Faculty has solicited such participation in one form or another on 15 different occasions. We explicitly asked departments to secure participation from their graduate student associations. Graduate students have been less involved than undergraduate students, but the working group on graduate student affairs nevertheless includes five graduate students.</p>
<p>SOS McGill raises the spectre of “forced relocation” of administrative and support staff. The phrase is provocative, but misleading. To be sure, there was a proposal – long abandoned – that would have entailed significant displacement of administrative and support staff, as well as faculty. The Faculty abandoned that proposal because of feedback from stakeholders who pointed out its operational weaknesses. Current proposals would see the majority of administrative and support staff remain where they are presently located.</p>
<p>The PPP project will not reduce the number of staff providing administrative and support services to departments. The loss of 7 staff in the 13 affected departments has already taken place because of the Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP) implemented by the University to cope with provincially imposed budget cuts. This means that 41 people are now available to do work once done by 48. The impact of the VRP was uneven: some departments experienced no staff reductions at all, while three departments saw the retirement of their senior administrative support staff person. These positions cannot be replaced because the budgets to support them no longer exist.</p>
<p>This is a fact with or without the PPP, but the project gives the Faculty a tool for smoothing out the effects of those staff reductions.</p>
<p>The PPP project is about more than staff reorganization. It is also about what we do and how we do it. Subgroups are looking at streamlining processes and reducing the amount of work that must be done. The project has examined better ways of integrating Faculty and department level advising. It has explored better ways of using information technology. It is concerned with enhanced training and career development opportunities for administrative and support staff.</p>
<p>One way or another, departments will have to develop partnerships and share resources to provide students and faculty an appropriate level of service. This means that administrative and support staff will have to provide service across departmental boundaries. There will be a challenging learning curve, but the staff in the Faculty of Arts has the talent and capacity to meet that challenge.<br />
I am surprised that anyone thinks differently.</p>

<p>The PPPP plan was supposed to centralize the administration of McGall’s Faculty of Farts in order to cut costs but has been criticized for not meeting the needs of students and also moving the Kinda Student-run Café into the former Farts Admissions office.</p>
<p>“We wanted sandwiches closer to us,” explained Dean of Students Andres Goodcopoulous, between bites of a reasonably priced but not-too-cheap tuna sandwich.</p>
<p>This resulted in a tragic shortage of coffee and sandwiches for McGall students who are unable to locate the relocated Kinda Student-run Café. Furthermore administrative consolidation has resulted in an administrative nightmare that has been called “Kafka-esque,” “near-Soviet in its dedication to inefficiency,” and “kinda inconvenient but not that much worse than what McGall had prior,” by various students who wished to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>For instance, in order to see an advisor for the Department of Pointing at Graphs, a McGall student must first see an academic advisor from the Department of Criticism and Critiquing. After being told that they are in the wrong place, they must get a form from the fifth floor of Mecock, now designated as the Floor of Forms and Associated Miscellanea (FAAM). After that they must run down to the basement of Mecock where the advising forms will be stamped. Following this the student must run to the FAAM floor and back down twice to get the same form and get it stamped in triplicate.</p>
<p>“I am sorry but I really don’t have time for an interview; need to get these forms stamped or else I can’t graduate,” said a U3 student in the Department of Criticism and Critiquing in between gasps.</p>
<p>Calls asking about student involvement in the shaping of this policy were answered by senior Farts administration. However, only the sound of moderately-priced potato salad being chewed was audible.</p>

Despite their surprise, everyone was supportive, and I’m extremely fortunate for that. When first coming out, I felt that my gayness was just one part of me, but as I have developed and gained a greater understanding of myself as a gay man, I can’t help but feel that in many ways my sexuality does define me.</p>
<p>I’m sure not everyone feels the same way. Although there’s a strong part of me that wants people to know I’m gay – in large part because of my experiences with people not assuming my sexuality – at the same time I know that my sexuality isn’t relevant to every conversation I have, and shouldn’t be. Sexuality is obviously a personal issue for everyone, and what people project and feel like projecting will vary widely.</p>
<p>As someone who’s struggled with the never-ending process of coming out, and as someone who often defies gay stereotypes, there are still situations where people don’t, and aren’t, going to know that I’m gay. It seems most people have internalized common stereotypes of who is, seems, or should be queer; and who isn’t. This can make life difficult as a queer person, as it can be uncomfortable to figure out when, and how, to come out to people, or if you even should.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">I’m constantly thinking about whether or not I seem gay – whether or not people I meet ‘pick up’ on my gayness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Because assumed straightness is such a thing, I feel like eventually it will come out that I am some sort of ‘other,’” said Concordia student Amy Collier, who identifies as queer. “I’m kind of forced to expose my sexuality in a way that straight people aren’t really forced to do and that makes me feel kind of vulnerable.”</p>
<p>I’m constantly thinking about whether or not I seem gay – whether or not people I meet ‘pick up’ on my gayness. What kind of vibes am I giving off? I make a conscious effort to cross my legs. Sometimes, I find ankle over knee more comfortable, but I know for the vibes I’m trying to give off, that just won’t cut it. I try to let my wrists hang, limp as can be. I try to dress well, never leave the house without applying copious amounts of hair gel, and exclusively have some sort of longer-on-the-top-shaved-sides haircut since most people I see with those cuts are queer as fuck.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I know plenty of people, especially when we first meet, are going to assume I’m straight. I get nervous that a nice, (seemingly) straight girl in class might mistake my kindness for something more, and it’s happened before.</p>
<p>It’s good to know that I’m not the only one that feels anxious in these situations. “There’s this panic or worry I have when I meet guys that I’ll say or do something that will be seen as flirting or taken as an advance,” said Collier. “I’ll go along with it but it can be kind of uncomfortable and lead to some awkward situations.”</p>
<p>There are other situations where I know people are going to assume I’m straight too. When I go to play soccer – in the park when Montreal isn’t a frozen wasteland, or indoors in the winter – conceptions of who plays sports will mean that no one thinks I’m gay.</p>
<p>I’ve felt for a long time that my sexuality has a tough time coexisting with my interest in playing and watching sports. Despite the homophobic tendencies of sports culture, I enjoy soccer as an activity and as a form of exercise. Despite internal dilemmas, I continue to love the sport, yet I can’t help but remember one of my gay friend’s remarks upon moving into my apartment this summer; before we really knew each other, he saw the posters of soccer players hanging in my bedroom and assumed I was some kind of bro.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">I’m still figuring out how badly I want people to know I’m gay, and how I’ll act and present myself in order to relate that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> For the most part, people won’t think I’m gay because I don’t possess certain traits people believe gays to possess. While many gay men I know have elements of a feminine twang to their voices, that’s something I don’t really have. Is it something I should work on? “My voice has definitely gotten gayer over the past few years,” said Angel, a McGill student and self-identified queer man. “And my vernacular has changed too.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Come to think of it, my own vocabulary has definitely changed. I may not perpetuate the stereotype of the ‘gay lisp,’ but did I used to call things “cute” or “adorable” as much as I do now? Definitely not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;">I realize that if I wanted to, it wouldn’t be that hard to make my sexuality more obvious, leaving less room for interpretation. Angel reminded me that gender is a process and performance. “When I first started painting my nails it was definitely a signal of my queerness,” she said. I myself have been tempted to paint my nails, but have only really considered it since quitting my job, where most people didn’t know I was gay. I could wear makeup, too; having dressed in drag a few times, I know that eyeliner makes me look damn hot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the most part, and especially among friends, I find that my sexuality is already understood. There are also situations where I know my gayness is much more likely to be assumed, especially when I’m with gay friends, at a gay bar, or in my History of Sexuality class, where for once straight boys are a minority.</p>
<p>I know sexuality isn’t relevant to all social interactions, but I can’t help but hate the common situation of crushing on some boy, only to find out he’s straight. Whether they’re a bit effeminate, dress really well, or give off ambiguous vibes, I’m often blinded by these adolescent-type crushes. Occupying a world in which sexuality and gender are increasingly fluid, I find no discernable difference between these hopeful crushes of mine, and seemingly-straight gay boys. So how am I supposed to identify those gay boys? Maybe I’m not. Maybe they love living in anonymity, not being identifiable or picked up on anyone’s ‘gaydar.’ And that’s totally fine. I’m still figuring out how badly I want people to know I’m gay, and how I’ll act and present myself in order to relate that. But given my statistical disadvantages in terms of the number of gay people out there, I can’t help but wish that there was just some way to know who’s gay and who’s not. I realize that’s far too much to ask, and a ridiculous request.</p>
<p>I’m not going to pretend my ‘gaydar’ can be sharpened, since there will always be plenty of gay boys who ‘seem straight’ and vice versa. I wish I could ask for gay vs. straight stereotypes to be thrown out the window, but that’s just not going to happen either. All I can do is own it, regardless of stereotypes, expectations, and people’s concepts of who seems or doesn’t seem queer.</p>

Courses accessed through Ontario Online will be transferable between all participating universities via ONTransfer.ca. Critics cite concerns about the quality of education and underlying motivation of the proposed program.</p>
<p>Brad Duguid, Ontario’s Minister of Training, Colleges, and Universities, announced the creation of Ontario Online last Monday. ONTransfer will be a partnership between post-secondary institutions in Ontario that will attempt to streamline credit transfers. Duguid explained that students would simply have to enter their credentials and click a button to see which of their completed credits would be accepted at which universities and colleges in the database. The eventual goal of the initiative is to ensure that students do not have to waste money and time redoing completed learning.</p>
<p>Graeme Stewart, communications director of the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations (OCUFA), is lobbying for more faculty input on the Ontario Online project, as there are currently no seats allocated to faculty members on the Board of Directors overseeing it. “I think that there are a few important stakeholders — admin, students, online learning experts — but it’s the actual faculty members who know best how to deliver the best quality experience,” said Stewart.</p>
<p>Duguid, in response to these concerns, said that the ministry has reached out to all concerned constituents, and has assembled the most experienced board that it could. He believes that the product it provides will be valuable enough that faculty associations will be pleased with it anyway.</p>
<p>In addition to the issue of faculty inclusion, Stewart has political concerns: “I support the goals and principles of accessibility and flexibility; it will really help students who maybe live far away from campus or have other responsibilities, but I am skeptical about the motivation.” He added: “If the government is looking to cut costs and avoid investing in higher education, it won’t work.”</p>
<p>Amir Eftekarpour, president of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance (OUSA) does not believe that lack of university instructors on the Board of Directors will compromise the quality of education available through the project. “I don’t see why we should have to choose between accessible education and quality education. We think there needs to be a sector-wide discussion to ensure that the quality is the same and that all students get the same access to faculty and the same access to support programming,” he said.</p>
<p>“Student executives on the ground are working with administration through their councils and student unions to make sure that principles of equality and accessibility are upheld,” said Eftekarpour, adding that he was pleased to see the provincial government make a commitment to enhancing online learning. Eftekarpour said that his primary concerns lie with per-student funding, as well as the direct impact on overall student learning experience.</p>
<p>Fifteen out of 20 Ontario universities are participating in the database launch; U of T is not among them. Duguid questioned the wisdom of this decision: “I think there’s going to be a lot of pressure on any institution that doesn’t participate — either in the Ontario Online, or in the ONTransfer initiative — because they’re going to be at a competitive disadvantage,” he said. “Institutions want students to transfer to them, and if they’re not marketing themselves on this guideline, if they’re not part of the guideline, they’re going to be very conspicuous by their absence.”</p>
<p>Sioban Nelson, vice-president, academic programs at U of T, explained the omission. “The credit transfer issue is something that we have been heavily involved in, and we have taken a cautious approach, built on where we know that we have a large volume of students who are interested in credit transfer and working on procedures for those students,” she said, referencing the seven-member University Transfer Credit Consortium. The consortium comprises U of T, the University of Waterloo, Western University, the University of Ottawa, the University of Guelph, Queen’s University, and McMaster University.</p>
<p>Under the current system, students can automatically acquire transfer credits for 30 first-year U of T courses by taking their equivalents offered by other members of the consortium. If a student wishes to transfer any other credits (including all credits from other institutions), he or she must submit an application. Credit transfer applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Nelson notes that the administration is concerned that if U of T were to automatically accept transfer credits for too many courses, although they may save time and money, they could be at risk of failing second year courses. “If the students fail the second-year course based on the first-year course, it doesn’t really help students much at all,” she said.</p>
<p>The Ontario Online project will launch in time for the 2015-2016 academic year, with the funds being expended gradually over the next three years.</p>

On November 29, 2013, the Cities Centre released a final news bulletin, reporting that the university administration had shamefully cut the Centre’s funding. This move represents a huge loss to the university community and the City of Toronto. Furthermore, it is yet another example of unilateral decision-making and the pervasive neoliberal governance of the U of T.</p>
<p>The Cities Centre was one of those rare parts of the university that was firmly rooted both within the city and academia. Members produced research that was useful for scholars, policy makers, and community organizers alike. Centre researchers tackled the difficult issues of inequality and access in the city, raising important questions about homelessness, suburban poverty, accessibility, immigration, and gentrification. Most importantly, it supported critical and progressive research by working with diverse community partners to address changes and challenges facing urban neighbourhoods and residents.</p>
<p>It is frustrating and disheartening that the university would abolish such a pillar of progressive urban policy and urban studies.  This move, and the opaque decision-making process, has not gone unnoticed. Influential individuals in urban policy and planning — like Toronto’s former mayor David Miller — have written letters in support of the Cities Centre. On December 16, 2013, the Toronto City Council received a motion — moved by councillor Joe Mihevc and seconded by councillor Mike Layton — concerning the closure of the centre. The motion called attention to the important work done by the Cities Centre, and expressed a desire to “see a strong funded and interdisciplinary research centre” continue at U of T. It was forwarded to U of T president Meric Gertler, and has been referred to the city’s executive committee.</p>
<p>The closure of the Cities Centre not only negatively affects the research and learning environment at the university, but it also impacts individual students and scholars. During my graduate studies in the Department of Geography and Planning, the Centre’s work was particularly important. Several studies provided the foundational research needed to conduct my doctoral work on illegal rooming houses and municipal bylaws in Toronto’s inner suburbs. In addition, the centre published research on pertinent urban issues that resulted in vigorous debates in graduate seminars and undergraduate lectures alike.</p>
<p>The Centre&#8217;s impact extends beyond the classroom; its innovative research directly informs urban policy and planning in Toronto. Furthermore, the centre created a hub for scholars from diverse disciplines to collaborate on projects and find a home for their work. I was fortunate enough to work with several faculty members associated with the centre, and welcomed the emails informing me of events, panel presentations, and publications. As I embark on my academic career, I wonder where I will turn when researching and publishing new work on contemporary progressive urban issues in Canada.</p>
<p>By cutting the funding to the Cities Centre, U of T is following a dangerous and ideological trend. Neoliberal governance is increasingly the norm at most North American universities, and U of T is no exception. The university administration has referred to undergraduate students as &#8220;basic income units,&#8221; conducted lengthy negotiations with unionized workers, and moved towards hiring more contract faculty versus providing stable tenured positions. Cutting funding to a centre that supported critical urban research, dialogue, and community partnerships aligns with this trend.</p>
<p>The lack of consultation and the proposed &#8220;merger&#8221; with another urban centre is indicative of a disturbing pattern in U of T&#8217;s administration. Decisions are made with no input from the affected parties, consultation, or formal external review. It is an appalling way to govern a university. Unfortunately, the Cities Centre is only one of many causalities. The closure ends an era of groundbreaking urban research, partnership-building, and direct research-to-policy influence, and it will be greatly missed.</p>

MacIntosh Sport Medicine Clinic</a> has been treating sports-related injuries for over 60 years.</p>
<p>Located in the basement of the University of Toronto’s Athletic Centre, this clinic is the oldest dedicated sports medicine facility in the world. In the 1990s, the clinic was named after Dr. David L. MacIntosh, a pioneer in the area of orthopaedic surgery, who began working at Hart House in the 1950s. MacIntosh was the first in the world to develop ACL injury diagnosis and ACL repair surgery. In addition, he was a physician for the Varsity Blues’ football and hockey teams for 25 years.</p>
<p>Marcel Charland, a certified athletic therapist and sport massage therapist, explained what makes the clinic unique is that “the comprehensive care an athlete receives at the MacIntosh clinic is world-class. Very few clinics have physiotherapists, athletic therapists, massage therapists, physicians, and orthopaedic surgeons all working together towards a common goal.”</p>
<p>Sandy Heming, another physiotherapist, said that she applied for the position because the opportunity to be in a clinic and on the field made the position a dream job.</p>
<p>“It’s a great clinic to work at. I have been here 12 years… it is a unique place; it is different. The atmosphere is fun here because everyone wants to get better and get back to doing what they want to do,” said Heming.</p>
<p>Clinic Manager Marr Kelly describes the staff as “a pretty tight-knit group of people, because we have such a small space to work in, and that makes this place unique.” Kelly began working at the clinic as a student at U of T, and has continued working there since then; she now oversees the clinic’s operations.</p>
<p>This clinic also serves as a teaching facility for kinesiology, athletic therapy, physiotherapy, and medical students. Charland did his placement as an athletic therapist student at the clinic in 1982; now, he mentors and teaches students.</p>
<p>“One of the things that makes this job so great is we not only have the opportunity to be in the clinic or on the field, but you also have the opportunity to mentor students and teach them,” said Charland.</p>
<p>“By teaching, you are also learning and the students also keep you current to a certain extent. It’s a great clinic for that — always having new students and new ideas.”</p>
<p>The clinic also includes a concussion clinic, which started around 1999 as solely a research effort. Dr. Michael Hutchison, the director of the concussion program, describes a concussion as “a type of traumatic brain injury [that] is recognized as a clinical syndrome of biomechanically induced alteration of brain function.”</p>
<p>Concussions can result from a direct blow to the head or the body. Other members of the research team include Dr. Doug Richards, Dr. Paul Comper, and Dr. Lynda Mainwaring. The clinic has been providing comprehensive care for sport-related concussions for approximately three years. In the 2012–2013 year, the clinic saw over 250 sport-related concussions.</p>
<p>The staff has experience working with athletes coming from a wide range of sports, and sees all manner of patients from weekend warriors to Olympians.</p>
<p>Dr. Ian Cohen, one of the sports physicians, joined the clinic staff in 1990 and has been working in sport medicine ever since he began practicing. Cohen’s experience as a sport physician extends from the Varsity Blues men’s ice hockey team and the national sailing team to the Toronto Argonauts.</p>
<p>Cohen was also a member of the medical staff at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, along with MacIntosh clinic colleague Dr. Mark Leung. Leung is currently one of the team physicians with the men’s national basketball team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Charland attended the 1988 Winter Olympics and 2000 Summer Olympics as a therapist, and has been selected as an alternate therapist for the 2014 Sochi Olympics.</p>

<p>As many of us already know, Pussy Riot is the all-female, eleven-membered (approximately ­­­— nobody’s quite sure) punk band that is known for its outspoken stance on lgbt rights, women’s rights, and why Putin may very well be the embodiment of evil. Their hefty resumé consists of performing a &#8220;punk prayer&#8221; in an Orthodox church, two years of imprisonment, and being officially declared &#8220;hooligans&#8221; by the Russian government. If given a grade, Pussy Riot undoubtedly scores an A+ on the punk rock scale. It has made its mark in Russia as a band that protests the homophobic acts of a corrupt government. In doing so, they have revived the authenticity of a genre that seems to have lost substance over the past few decades.</p>
<p>During the genesis of punk rock, while the war in Vietnam neared its end — and Britain’s economy began an alarmingly steep decline — groups of disaffected youth started creating music that spoke directly to the higher authorities. The music usually focused on topics such as unemployment, scandals surrounding politicians and government officials, and other types of injustices. Known for their elaborate hairdos and their habit of spitting on their audience as a form of greeting, one could say that the punks were a slightly more intimidating version of the hippies from the years prior.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this coterie protested some of the many injustices that affected their everyday life, and in doing so, created a genre of music that matched its oddball subculture.</p>
<p>Bands like The Clash sang about problems with the law and its enforcement in England, while the Sex Pistols and Black Flag attacked social conformity and strongly encouraged mayhem-induced rebellion. Even in America, Charged GBH and GG Allin expressed anti-war sentiments in their songs (as well as a vague desire to kill the then-US president). Later on, in the short-lived “grunge era” of the early &#8217;90s, bands like Nirvana got their say on the state of American society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was also around this time that punk rock petered out, giving way to a new influx of punk-related bands like Blink 182, Green Day, and Ajax’s very own Sum 41. The bands from the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s that had made a name for themselves by taking strong political stances all seemed to disappear, causing a decline in politically based punk music. Instead, sub-genres of punk that were less focused on the political, and more focused on making unpleasant guitar noises and being aggressively loud gained ground. Many would say that this is the time when punk rock kicked the bucket.</p>
<p>After years without a significant punk rock scene to be heard of, the Russian collective is everything that genuine punk music was originally meant to be, and more. The lengths to which it has gone to protest the horrifying situation for the LGBT community in Russia has elevated it from musicians to full-scale activists. Its determination to protest landed the members&#8217; in jail, sparking a couple of lengthy hunger strikes. Despite the obvious setbacks, the band continues to spread the message, with anti-hits like “Putin Has Pissed Himself” or “Putin Chickens Out.&#8221; Now finally freed, we can only assume Pussy Riot will continue to wreak havoc until justice is served.</p>

<p>The bicycle, a single frame on two wheels, is an inexpensive, environmentally friendly and convenient mode of transportation in a congested city like Toronto. However, dwindling support for implementation and improvement of necessary infrastructure limits the growth of the city’s cycling community.</p>
<p>Biking in Toronto is a relatively up-and-coming phenomenon. The first bike path in the city, <a href="https://maps.google.ca/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=210800207352036129429.0004c9d413eab28bbf240">the Beltline Trail</a>, was reluctantly built in the shadow of the Belt Line Railway when it halted operation in the early 1970s. The first marked bike lane was not installed until the late 1970s under the supervision of Parks Commissioner Tommy Thompson. It was not for another 40 years that the first separated bike lane was built in 2012, running north-south on Sherbourne Avenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A bicycle friendly city?</h4>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-42574" style="height: 450px; width: auto; margin-left: -65px;" alt="Bike 2 (1)" src="http://thevarsity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bike-2-1.jpg" />The Toronto City Cycling Committee was founded in 1975 to encourage biking and bike safety. In 2001, <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/staticfiles/city_of_toronto/transportation_services/cycling/files/pdf/chapter03.pdf ">the Toronto Bike Plan</a> was established by City Council to promote cycling and reduce injury. In the plan overview, the initiative sought to achieve these goals with a view towards actualizing “a vision of a more Bicycle Friendly City” by both managing “existing programs and infrastructure” and fostering “new and or improved cycling programs and facilities.”</p>
<p>These goals have not been entirely achieved, however. There is currently a staggeringly small number of bike lanes in the city, with 110 kilometres of urban bike lanes in a city with 5,617 kilometres of road.</p>
<p>Even though Toronto has North America’s third largest public transportation system, cycling infrastructure is virtually non-existent, even at a time when bike culture is rapidly expanding. In recent years, three bike lanes were removed on Pharmacy, Birchmount, and Jarvis.</p>
<p>Safety is also a concern. From 1986 until 2010, there were 31,481 bicycle collisions reported in Toronto, some of which resulted in major injuries and fatalities. Overall, however, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/explore-the-data-toronto-bicycle-collisions-mapped-over-25-years/article543684/">few cyclists are involved in collisions annually in Toronto</a>, with just 1,200 reported incidents per year. However, this number has not improved in recent years, and many collisions are not reported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cycling culture</h4>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-42577" style="max-width: 600px; height: 360px; width: auto; margin-left: -65px;" alt="ALICE XUE/THE VARSITY" src="http://thevarsity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_5045.jpg" /></p>
<p>The number of people riding bikes in Toronto increased by 30 per cent from 2001 to 2006, and continues to rise — an effect of cycling becoming much more than a means to commute in the city. Cycling is now invested with a growing downtown community of green, health-conscious people of all ages.</p>
<p>Group rides organized by organizations such as <a href="http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/ca/en">Chain Reaction</a> and Dark Horse Espresso Bar gather cyclists together to rove the city with like-minded company. Various blogs are dedicated to cyclist culture, showcasing the street style of cyclists and recent technology and gear, such as <a href="http://bikingtoronto.com"><i>bikingtoronto.com</i></a>, which includes events listings and lively discussions and <a href="http://www.416cyclestyle.com"><i>416cyclestyle.com</i></a>.<a href="http://iBikeTO.ca"><i> iBikeTO.ca</i></a> is a community-run blog run by Herb van den Dool, a Toronto cyclist. This site includes <a href="http://www.ibiketo.ca/guide/toronto-cycling-maps">a map feature called “Ride the City,”</a> also available as an iPhone app, which searches for the safest or most direct bike lane route to your destination. <a href="http://dandyhorsemagazine.com/blog/"><i>Dandyhorse</i></a> is a print-based magazine dedicated to cycling in Toronto. Various eclectic bike shops in the city also serve the cyclist community.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SeJxYv9H_5Q?rel=0" height="264" width="470" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Young people are among those joining in on this culture, as busy students lugging books and bags use the bike as a mode of commuting and running their errands. Saving on the cost of a transit pass also entices students to employ bikes for transportation. <a href="http://bikechain.utoronto.ca/index.php">BikeChain</a>, a levy-funded service offered at U of T, provides students with tools and education to service their bikes cheaply on campus.</p>
<p>Saving time and money are not the only motivating factors for students who bike, however. “Despite the lack of infrastructure, [biking] is probably the best way to get around,” suggests Alex Tizzard, a fourth-year student and cycling enthusiast in Urban Studies at the university.</p>
<p>He adds, “Right now… it’s obvious that cities have been built and rebuilt to accommodate the car. Now, there is an increased desire and awareness to create more complete streets… I think there needs to be more of a balance, which there clearly is not.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Bells on Bloor</h4>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-42585" style="height: 450px; width: auto; margin-left: -65px;" alt="DSCF2997" src="http://thevarsity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSCF2997.jpg" />With rising popularity and a cycling community of almost 1 million people, the cycling population, although a minority, is too large to ignore. Still, cycling safety is not prioritized in municipal government, and existing infrastructure fails to create a safe environment on the road. Bikes share the road in uncomfortably close proximity with large, heavy vehicles, posing challenges to both cyclists and drivers who struggle to share lanes.</p>
<p>Cyclists in Toronto are in agreement that the change that needs to occur to achieve better bike infrastructure in the city is an overall increase in bike lanes. Albert Koehl is the founding member of <a href=" http://bellsonbloor.org">Bells on Bloor </a>and a board member of the Annex Residents Association. He comments, “We need a lot more bike lanes. We have 110 km of bike lane on a road system that is over 5200 km. We have virtually no bike lanes, we have no bike network at all. You can ride up and down Sherbourne, but what does it connect to?”</p>
<p>The lack of connecting lanes is a major issue, as there currently is no separated east-west bike lane that spans the downtown core. Koehl adds, “It’s a question of making a network and getting people to where they are going.”</p>
<p>Bells on Bloor advocates for an east-west route on Bloor Street as a main artery for an improved bike lane system.</p>
<p>Bloor Street is a continuous road with no streetcar tracks and a subway line running right under it, rendering it an ideal route for cyclists. Continuity allows for a direct route without twists and turns. The lack of streetcar tracks eliminates the risk of bike tires getting caught in the tracks, trapping cyclists in dangerous positions or swerving them off the tracks into oncoming traffic. The proximity of the subway allows commuters from the surrounding suburbs without cars to easily transport their bikes downtown.</p>
<p>The proposed Bloor Street bike lane pilot project would stretch from Sherbourne Street to Shaw Street, passing St. George Street. Other stretches of road in Toronto have also been suggested as potential routes for bikes, including a lane on nearby Dupont Street stretching from Dundas Street West to Yonge Street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Resistance on City Council</h4>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/m5wCBNZfh0I?rel=0" height="264" width="470" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
Recently, the Toronto Public Works Committee approved a $450,000 environmental assessment (EA) for the proposed bike lanes on Bloor Street and Dupont Street. Although this was presented as a major development, according to Koehl, an EA is not a requirement for the construction of a bike lane.</p>
<p>Bells on Bloor reached out to City Council to point out this discrepancy, stating in a email that, “…the construction of a bike lane is considered pre-approved, and only requires public notification prior to implementation.”</p>
<p>The proposed lanes would remove two of the four car lanes on Bloor Street, replacing the twenty-four hour parking spots along the road with bike lanes. The EA will also look at the impact of implementing a Dupont Street bike lane.</p>
<p>An EA, which Koehl’s groups suggests is unnecessary, is an expensive study that will not begin until fall 2014 and will take a year to complete. Discussions of actually installing the Bloor Street bike lane will be delayed until 2015 as a result of this undertaking.</p>
<p>City councillor Mike Layton of Ward 19 Trinity-Spadina challenges this view, suggesting that an environmental assessment, which includes looking at economic and social factors, is necessary because of the many factors involved that need to studied, including the impact on local businesses and the arrangement, unidirectional or bidirectional, that would be most appropriate.</p>
<p>In an interview with <i>The Varsity</i>, Layton adds, “If you just go ahead and put a lane in, you don’t address the needs of the people.” The importance, he expressed, lies in “creat[ing] acceptance for the bike lane and support for it.”</p>
<p>The EA for the Bloor Street lanes was halted in 2011 when Mayor Rob Ford gained power, but as his power waned, Layton notes, “We got it back,” particularly with the push from councillor Adam Vaughan of Ward 20 Trinity-Spadina.</p>
<p>City councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, chair of the Public Works Committee, is the only city councillor that voted against the EA for the Bloor Street bike lanes, stating in a council meeting that it is, “the wrong street to put bike lanes on.”</p>
<p>He added, “Congestion and gridlock are a real problem in this city and adding more bike lanes and decreasing capacity on an important arterial road that runs from one end of the city to another will make it even worse.” Minnan-Wong’s office declined to comment.</p>
<p>Layton suggests that most councillors are aware of the need for bike lanes — just not in their ward: “A councillor’s position about bike lanes has a lot to do with the area they represent.”</p>
<p>Loss of parking, Layton suggests, is the major source of complaints in response to bike lanes. He adds, “Bloor is a vibrant and commercial street and it depends on parking to a certain degree.”</p>
<p>However, Bloor West Village drivers provide only an estimated 10 per cent of business to shops and restaurants along Bloor Street. The rest of the business comes mostly from cyclist and pedestrian traffic. Layton says it’s now a matter of proving these figures to store owners that would be directly affected by loss of parking spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Towards a friendlier city</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-42586" style="height: 450px; width: auto; margin-left: -65px;" alt="DSCF3017" src="http://thevarsity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSCF3017.jpg" />As an alternative to the EA study, Bells on Bloor has proposed a pilot bike lane project that would run the length of Bloor Street, including past U of T’s St. George campus, connecting to St. George bike lanes and increasing access to the Grace and Shaw north-south lanes. Koehl notes, “A pilot would show people what it would look like… [it’s] a way to deal with people who are fearful and reluctant.”</p>
<p>With a pilot, Torontonians can be provided with firsthand evidence of the impact of implementing the full bike lane, rather than with the expensive cost of a study that is not legally required in order to put paint to pavement.</p>
<p>Koehl also suggests that the study is repetitive, given that a 1992 study already deemed Bloor-Danforth an ideal east-west bike route.</p>
<p>Council is taking a step forward now with current plans to install a separated bidirectional bike lane on Harbord Street.</p>
<p>The frustration surrounding this issue among cyclists, advocates, and councillors alike is obvious. “Putting a bike lane on Bloor is no complex thing — you paint a line and you’re done,” Koehl claims.</p>
<p>Layton contends, however, that the addition of the bike lane requires careful consideration. The strongest consensus in the bike lanes debate is the necessity of improving infrastructure for cyclists. Layton suggests that Toronto would reap the benefits of bike lanes, which “help our economy, get people out of cars, alleviate gridlock, keep a healthier society, and decreases money we spend later in life because it’s an active form of transportation.”</p>
<p>He adds that the critical step needed in order to push the city to implement more bike lanes is to increase constituents’ enthusiasm for the project: “As more people look into cycling as a more feasible way of transportation in their neighbourhood, their attitudes will be changing.”</p>
<p>On his commute from Christie Pitts to City Hall, Layton knows it takes a fraction of the time to bike than to take the TTC to get to his workplace, and predicts it would take twice as long by car. Not only that, but, “you tend to get to work and school less stressed out [when you bike].”</p>
<p>Michael Ly, a second-year molecular genetics and microbiology specialist at U of T says he rides his bike “&#8230;because of the enjoyment [he gets] out of it. The fresh summer wind blowing on your face and the freedom to perform any maneuver are examples of reasons why bike riding is incomparable to other methods of transportation.”</p>
<p>Despite safety concerns and the lack of bike lanes, dedicated cyclists will continue to fight for their place on Toronto’s streets. Toronto will be a friendlier, more harmonized city when all modes of transportation are accommodated. With the implementation of carefully planned bike lanes, rather than endanger one another, cyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles alike will be able to safely share the road in Toronto.</p>
<p>Tizzard reflects, “Both cars and bikes have their place in the city. It’s about creating streets that accommodate [both].”</p>

The policy does not take into account a person’s ability to produce clean blood tests. Student organizations are speaking out against the policy, including the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), and U of T’s LGBTOUT.</p>
<p>The motion to instate the five-year deferral period for MSM began in 2011, following a 2010 Ontario Supreme Court ruling that stated that there was insufficient evidence to support a lifetime ban, but upheld the ban anyway.</p>
<p>While CBS says that the new policy is a step forward, many have criticized the policy.</p>
<p>The CFS, alongside the Canadian AIDS society, has launched a campaign against the policy entitled “End The Ban.” The campaign aims to eliminate the discrimination that prevents MSM from donating blood. It raises several points as to why the policy is both unfair and ineffectual. It claims that at-risk behaviours practiced by heterosexuals are overlooked, that the policy ignores the present blood donor shortage, and that it lacks sufficient scientific evidence. Alastair Woods, a chairperson for the CFS, opposes the ban. “Ideally, we want the ban to be overturned entirely and for the CBS to move towards a risk-assessment model that targets unsafe sexual practices regardless of the sexual orientation of the persons involved,” said Woods.</p>
<p>U of T’s LGBTOUT organization is also critical of the ban, calling it a fake fix. Corey Scott, LGBTOUT’s public relations officer, said that the ban actually worsens the situation: “Instead of being banned for life, men who have had sex with men are being asked to reform their lifestyles, abstain, or lie about the last time they have had sex.” Scott said that the focus of the issue should shift to promoting safer sex supplies. “Ultimately there are better screening methods to ensure blood donations are safe. This really shouldn’t have to be a queer issue — CBS needs to get with the times.”</p>

<p>Doctor Mark Downing, the chief of infectious disease at St. Joseph’s Health Centre, says that while MSM continue to be a high-risk group for HIV infection, it is important to consider the lifestyle of every individual involved when assessing the risk of having blood disease. “Part of it is going back to the ‘80s — when the epidemic started it was identified with MSM, so it has been stigmatized over time.”</p>
<p>Downing praised the new policy. “The issues that blood services face is the window period between when an individual gets infected and when the test is positive. I think that the move to the five-year ban was a good one. I can see where they are coming from and why CBS is taking gradual steps towards moving forward. It is unfortunate that MSM are stigmatized, but the issue is that CBS is looking at all sorts of groups and it can be difficult to determine what is reasonable and what is not,” he said.</p>
<p>Criteria for the eligibility of blood donors differ globally. In Britain and Australia, the deferral period for MSM is one year. In Italy and some other European countries, there is no ban on blood donations from MSM. Instead, one’s ability to donate blood is based on whether or not they are engaged in unsafe sexual behaviours. In contrast, the United States maintains a permanent ban of blood donation from MSM.</p>

When I found out that evening, I was horrified.</p>
<p>Living in Canada, we sometimes forget how privileged we are to be in a society that embraces diversity so openly that it is considered to be a part of our national identity. We are seen as a bastion for LGBTQ rights, having been among the first to legalize same-sex marriage, beginning in 2003. Pride Week in Toronto remains one of the largest LGBTQ pride festivals in the world, and our city is being internationally recognized as the host for WorldPride 2014, taking place this summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, international prospects for LGBTQ rights have not been as progressive. From the Russian ban on gay propaganda to India’s reinstatement of Section 377 recriminalizing sexual acts “against the order of nature,” and even Nigeria’s newly signed anti-gay law, it is clear that worldwide LGBTQ equality has yet to be realized. So maybe it’s not surprising that such a malicious and cowardly act was perpetrated on our own campus, despite being in a society that is generally more accepting.</p>
<p>The reality is, homophobia exists. It doesn’t have to be physical harassment or so-called gay bashing, homophobia can be subtle and much more sinister. The vandalized mural is toxic in its very nature, because those attitudes end up permeating the community, making it that much easier to spread homophobia and hate.</p>
<p>The issue is even more contentious within the discipline of engineering. Already a male-dominated field, the stereotype is that engineers display a degree of hegemonic masculinity and in particular, tend to be homophobic. “That’s so gay” is thrown around to express dissatisfaction, but the inaccurate use of the word only acts to cement its meaning in association with negative connotations. We have also witnessed instances in the past where homophobic statements were made. They’re often thinly veiled as a &#8220;harmless&#8221; joke, and it may very well be just that to the person saying it, but not always to the LGBTQ individual who hears it.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-42541" style="max-width: 600px; height: 318px; width: auto; margin-left: -65px;" alt="The vandalized mural. PHOTO COURTESY LGBTQASE" src="http://thevarsity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Similarly, the vandalism could also be dismissed as a non-issue, since it wasn’t very visible anyway. Could you imagine how an LGBTQ student in engineering, already feeling alienated, would feel upon seeing that? This is what equality ultimately boils down to: the golden rule, to treat others as you would like others to treat you. Surely, none of us would wish that feeling of isolation upon anyone.</p>
<p>This incident and its ramifications are relevant to all of us, regardless of our sexual orientation or identity. I would like to think that, in general, the university community is accepting of sexual diversity. Having this reputation tarnished by a homophobic act should make us take a step back, and reconsider the need to speak up against this type of behaviour. While confrontation is usually uncomfortable for all parties, it is a necessity. I implore everyone, especially allies of LGBTQ people, to take the initiative to challenge any statement or action that is homophobic in nature, as LGBTQ individuals often feel unsafe doing so themselves. We must remember to always speak out against oppression, before it becomes the norm.</p>
<p>The morning after the mural was vandalized, a few LGBTQase executives and I went to paint over the offending language. It is difficult to say if this was the right decision — should we have left the vandalism as is, and perhaps provoked discussion throughout the community? Or would that risk catalyzing further homophobic acts on campus? We can’t say for sure, but I really do believe that LGBTQ-supportive individuals on campus outnumber those that are not.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about how you can support LGBTQ individuals, LGBTQase will be hosting a discussion on this incident and homophobia in general within Science and Engineering on February 6, 2014 at 6 pm. Pink Shirt Anti-Bullying Day will also be celebrated on February 26, 2014. Locations have yet to be determined. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fskule.ca%2Flgbtqase-event-meet-greet%2F&amp;h=WAQEctzUZ">Please refer to our website for more information.</a></p>

<p>Recently, Médecins Sans Frontières and other organizations have been fighting to stop the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership from barring access to generic drugs, which are much less expensive than their brand name counterparts. For one young researcher, however, moral interests are far more important. Jessie MacAlpine is a first-year life sciences student who has developed a treatment for malaria. She has filed for a patent on the treatment, and she plans to facilitate its distribution so as to maximize access to it.</p>
<p>MacAlpine&#8217;s project, <i>Mustard Oil as an Apicomplexan-targeting Drug Therapy for Plasmodium falciparum</i>, was extraordinarily successful at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, where she won Best of Category for Medicine and Health Sciences. Most recently, MacAlpine was the Canadian ambassador at the European Union Contest for Young Scientists, where she won the International Cooperation Prize.</p>
<p><i>The Varsity</i> spoke with MacAlpine about scientific discovery, research, and the current climate of the biomedical field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>The Varsity: </i></b><i>Could you describe your research?</i></p>
<p><b><i>Jessie MacAlpine:</i></b> I began doing research at the age of 12, completing the majority of my work in my own basement as well as at a laboratory at Western University. I was always a very curious child, and after seeing a poster advertising the Canada-Wide Science Fair in my elementary school, I was very excited to begin doing my own scientific experiments.</p>
<p>In high school, I was an active member and later co-president of a club which worked with Free the Children to break the cycle of poverty in developing countries.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2012, we were discussing potential health initiatives we could undertake in the following school year, which made me question why it was so common to fundraise for mosquito nets instead of for actual medications or vaccines. I went home to complete a simple internet search to see what drugs were available to combat global health problems and came across a newspaper article describing the potential of herbicides to treat malaria.</p>
<p>Having spent the past two years creating a bioherbicide, I thought it would be interesting to see if I could transform the compound into an antimalarial medication. I then started my research in May of 2012 at the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health at MaRS Discovery District, where I was supervised by both Dr. Ian Crandall and Dr. Kevin Kain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>TV: </i></b><i>How are you planning to make your discovery available?</i></p>
<p><b>JM: </b>I am currently working on <i>in vivo </i>studies to confirm the drug’s efficacy within a mammal model. If this experiment returns results as promising as the <i>in vitro </i>studies, the hope will be to conduct clinical trials before establishing potential distribution channels. The drug itself is very inexpensive – the necessary dose costs approximately a millionth of a cent – resulting in the major inhibitor to treatment being distribution. Potentially partnering with organizations such as the World Health Organization or Malaria No More could allow the inexpensive drug to reach those who are most affected by the disease. As well, because mustard oil is readily available in many malaria-endemic regions, these organizations could potentially run awareness campaigns to ensure the public is informed of the oil’s antimalarial properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>TV: </i></b><i>Why have you chosen to patent?</i></p>
<p><b>JM: </b>As the research moves forward in its development, I chose to patent for a variety of reasons. The first was to ensure the drug remained in my name so that a larger pharmaceutical company couldn’t get hold of the information and claim the idea. The second was to make it easier to approach investors and potential laboratories to facilitate clinical trials, who are often more willing to take on a compound that has been patented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>TV: </i></b><i>What would happen if a pharmaceutical company discovered your treatment first? </i></p>
<p><b>JM: </b>If a pharmaceutical company had discovered the treatment first, they would have had the right to file for patent and potentially transform it into an expensive, brand-name medication for wealthy travelers visiting developing countries. My purpose for patenting was thus to discourage pharmaceutical companies from exploiting the efficacy of the compound for unnecessary profit. As an antimalarial treatment aimed at developing countries, the medication’s purpose is not profit, and a patent was filed to ensure I remained in control of the compound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>TV: </i></b><i>What are your thoughts on the current state of the pharmaceutical industry? How are existing healthcare products distributed in developing nations?</i></p>
<p><b>JM: </b>I believe that the pharmaceutical industry could benefit from a few major changes. The commercialization of pharmaceuticals has resulted in a loss of access to basic health care, which was the original purpose of mass drug development. It appears that companies are increasingly focused on developing an excessive number of drugs instead of improving existing treatments or modifying the prescription process to reduce resistance. As well, there is significantly more research and funding available for studies related to Western diseases and conditions which have the potential to make pharmaceutical companies large revenue. From an ethical perspective, pharmaceutical companies appear to be losing the moral standards of modern medicine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Existing healthcare products are distributed in developing nations by a variety of charity organizations. Unfortunately, despite funding and existing medications, many people continue to go untreated. Using malaria as an example, there are still many places in Africa where a single nurse has to diagnose and treat over 200 000 people. Often, this nurse lacks proper training and has to diagnose patients using visual symptoms and a thermometer. Drug resistance continues to be a major concern, as patients are given small dosages of medication and are unable to take treatment to completion. This encourages resistance and has resulted in the inefficacy of many promising drugs in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>TV: </i></b><i>You’</i><i>re enrolled in the Arthur Schawlow stream of Vic One, which deals with the ethical and societal contexts of science. Why did you choose to take those courses instead of more technical courses that could further your research? In an ideal world, how would science and society interact?</i></p>
<p><b>JM: </b>As a scientist, it is imperative to seek interdisciplinary studies in order to approach research from a well-rounded perspective. As a first year student, I chose to take the Arthur Schawlow stream of Vic One as it offered a unique opportunity to learn about the social context of science in a small classroom setting. Apart from the fascinating curriculum, I chose this course to develop a philosophical and theoretical approach to science and to critically evaluate the scientific process and research conductance in today’s society.</p>
<p>In its pure form, science is the pursuit of knowledge and attempt to describe the wonders of the universe. In the past, science has played a major role in the development of society, and in order for it to continue this impact, it is essential that proper communication is maintained between the scientific community and general public. Clear communication of ideas will allow researchers and consumers to work together to solve some of the biggest problems facing humanity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>TV: </i></b><i>What advice would you give to undergraduate students looking to get involved in research?</i></p>
<p><b>JM: </b>If I were to give one piece of advice, it would be to investigate a field you’re interested in and find a professor who might be willing to let you work in their lab. It is then much easier to approach a professor if you have an idea already in mind and have developed a potential experimental design. Even if you aren’t allowed to work on your own project, approaching a professor with a plan shows initiative and genuine interest in their work. It is always difficult to get your first research position, but once you have a foot in the door, the experience will assist you in getting positions for the remainder of your career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>TV: </i></b><i>What&#8217;s next?</i></p>
<p><b>JM: </b>The next step is to finish <i>in vivo </i>trials. If the results continue to be promising, it will then be a matter of locating a lab to facilitate clinical trials. I may also run an observational study in India, where the oil is already largely used for cooking. Despite my research focusing on the efficacy of the raw oil, it is possible that there is still a degree of antimalarial efficacy observed with consumption of the cooked compound. An observational study would hopefully allow a trend such as this to be determined. Finally, if all stages of drug testing return positive results, I will have to partner with a global health organization to organize awareness and distribution channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UTSU has been raising this issue for over two years. Under current president Munib Sajjad, the UTSU began to study the issue in March 2013. Previous president Shaun Shepherd campaigned for the change in the spring of 2012. Neither the university administration nor the city has heard of any recent developments of the campaign. They also stated that there are no active plans to pedestrianize St. George Street.</p>
<p>“The only thing I’ve heard about it I’ve read in <i>The Varsity</i>,” said Scott Mabury, vice-president, university operations. “We have no plans, not studying, not looking into closing St. George because of the overall potential ramifications to the campus.”</p>
<p>The university considered pedestrianizing St. George Street, Devonshire Place, and Willcocks Street in a pilot project four years ago. The university’s plan for St. George Street called for a closure north of Russell Street up to the loading dock of the Sidney Smith and Ramsay Wright laboratories. The problem was that the traffic would spill onto Huron Street, a narrow street with parking on one side.</p>
<p>“We did not implement at that time anything on St. George because the potential disruption factor was just huge. Having a change to St. George that makes something else much more materially worse is not something that we can easily go into,” said Mabury.</p>
<p>A portion of Willcocks Street has now been permanently closed to traffic. Once more, the university is looking into pedestrianizing a part of Devonshire Street, which was closed due to construction of the Goldring Centre, said Mabury.</p>
<p>Despite the obstacles, Sajjad said that there may be some in U of T’s administration that support the idea. He plans to introduce the idea to U of T president Meric Gretler when the UTSU meets with him later in the term.</p>
<p>“It’s all about raising the fact with the administration,” said Sajjad. “If there’s a fear of increase of traffic and endangering streets, we are going to show how it’s going to go and how safe it’s going to be.”</p>
<p>The proposal would have to be approved by City Council, and prove that the pedestrianization of St. George Street would be useful for the community.</p>
<p>“Looking to close St. George, that’s a major exercise,” said Fiona Chapman, the City of Toronto’s pedestrian projects manager. Chapman said that this would involve looking at local traffic laws and the local traffic network to see the feasibility of such a project. While there is no one way to begin the process, the recommended first step is to approach the local city councillor.</p>
<p>Sajjad said that Adam Vaughan, the Ward 20 councillor, supports the idea. Vaughan could not be reached for comment as of press time. Even with the local councillor’s backing, Chapman said that the decision would ultimately rest with City Council, and that they would likely not support the closure.</p>
<p>“It can be a challenge to try and close a street in Toronto and then find that it’s not heavily used by pedestrians,” said Ward 27 councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam, who is the local councillor for Ryerson University. Wong-Tam worked to close Gould Street, which bisects the campus. She said that closing Gould Street was a long process completed in increments, with a lot of consultation with local business and community groups.</p>
<p>“Gould Street works so well because of the heavy density of pedestrian traffic,” said Wong-Tam. She added that St. George Street does not have the same pedestrian density at all times of day, and therefore may not be as successful as a pedestrian-only zone.</p>
<p>Tim Grant, chair of the Harbord Village Residents’ Association, agrees. He said that while St. George has heavy pedestrian traffic during the day, it is nearly empty after 9:00 pm. Grant said that the ideal proposal would keep the street open at night when there is less pedestrian traffic, and include bike lanes during the day.</p>
<p>“The problem with all these things when you put time limits… is the changeover. It’s five minutes to [the changeover], five minutes after, where cars aren’t sure where they can go,” said Grant. Despite his concerns, Grant supports the idea.</p>
<p>Paul Kulig, principal of Regional Architects — which was associated with the St. George Street redesign in 1997 — said that the full pedestrianization of the street may not be practical.</p>
<p>“The most successful streets are ones that allow for a mix of uses but where the pedestrians are still dominant,” Kulig said. “We felt [the design] found a balance that maintained the vitality and life in that street.”</p>

As usual, however, international students are not eligible to run, causing many to repeat their calls to change the Council’s structure.</p>
<p>At last year’s first Special General Meeting of the University of Toronto Students’ Union (UTSU), the union’s membership called for international students to be included on the Governing Council. Numerous student governors have pledged to work on getting international students representation.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-42671" style="max-width: 225px; height: 600px; width: auto; margin-left: -65px;"  alt="GC SIDEBAR" src="http://thevarsity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GC-SIDEBAR.jpg" />The Governing Council is composed of 50 members, including students, staff, alumni, and government appointees, and gets its authority from the provincial University of Toronto Act. The Act includes the requirement that “no person shall serve as a member of the Governing Council unless he is a Canadian citizen.” As 15 per cent of U of T students are not Canadian citizens, the requirement is controversial for many,</p>
<p>Monica Layarda, a student from Malaysia, finds the requirement ridiculous: “Every student should be given equal opportunity to pursue what he or she desires. Since the population of international students at U of T has increased substantially in recent years, they should be given access to a greater representation. I can see no real reason why nationality or citizenship should stand in the way.”</p>
<p>Layarda’s frustrations are shared by UTSU vice-president, internal &amp; services Cameron Wathey, also an international student.</p>
<p>“I believe that we should have a democratic say in the highest decision-making body at U of T. We pay the largest tuition fees in Canada &#8230; and we’ve seen an increase of higher than 50 per cent in international tuition fees. International students should be able to participate in the democratic structure of the institution that we provide so much revenue to,” said Wathey.</p>
<p>Some student representatives of Governing Council are against the citizenship requirement. “I am troubled that international students don’t have a formal voice at this level of governance, given that they are a substantial and vital component of the community,” said Alexandra Harris, a graduate student governor. Aidan Fishman, a two-term undergraduate governor, also expressed concerns: “If you are a student at this university, studying at this university, paying fees at this university that are higher than those who are Canadian citizens, you have a right to serve on Governing Council.”</p>
<p>The University of Toronto Act, last amended in 1978, has yet to adapt to changes at the university, which explains the lack of international representation. “[An international student] who is not a citizen, in the same way they can’t serve as mayor or a member of Parliament, shouldn’t serve on Governing Council,” said Fishman, describing the rationale behind the rule. “The vast majority of governors and administrators at the university recognize that it doesn’t make a lot of sense for international students not to be represented, and there have been some legal questions about what can be done.”</p>
<p>Despite widespread opposition towards the requirement, little has changed. A 2010 Council report concluded that there was nothing compelling to change, and that its representation should be preserved. However, with the increase of international students and the efforts of student unions, such as the UTSU, the issue has become more apparent. Louis Charpentier, secretary of the Governing Council, highlighted the October 2013 Council, where chair Judy Goldring “initiated a process” to look into the role of international students, with the results to be released in February. Harris also highlighted a scheduled meeting between student leaders and U of T president Meric Gertler to address various issues, including the international student experience.</p>
<p>Any changes to the Governing Council will require provincial support. Fishman argued that the Governing Council is nervous of reopening the debate on the U of T Act.</p>
<p>“Especially in a minority government situation, where the government that opens legislation doesn’t necessarily have control over the final outcome of that legislation, the administration is nervous about asking for the Act to be amended, because once it’s open for debate, parties could start trying to make different impositions,” said Fishman.</p>
<p>In a statement, the office of the Ministry for Training, Colleges and Universities said, “We would be happy to review any proposal that the University of Toronto would like to put forward on this, or any other matter.”</p>
<p>Although there is widespread agreement on the need to include international students, the same cannot be said when it comes to the question of increasing the number of student seats. The UTSU promotes the view of “the more student representation, the better,” and a more proportional representation. Fishman says that while government is needed to make changes, “there is no appetite on the administration’s behalf for a Council where half the seats are student seats.”</p>
<p>This controversy is similar to the related issue of student representation on the Governing Council in general. Students pay a total of 53 per cent of U of T’s 2013 — 2014 operating budget, but are only allotted eight out of the 50 council seats.</p>
<p>“I don’t think most students, especially most undergraduate students, have the breadth and depth of knowledge to deal with those issues in the same way that professors, alumni or even government appointees might have,” said Fishman.</p>
<p>Elections for the 2014 — 2015 Governing Council run from February 10 to February 21.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each term, UBC REC hosts what&#8217;s known as &#8220;shopping week,&#8221; where students can try fitness, boot camp, cycle fit, martial arts, dance, yoga, pilates, aquatics, skating and even learn-to-play hockey classes for free. With such a wide variety and over 100 different time slots to choose from, you&#8217;re bound to find something you&#8217;ll enjoy that fits your schedule. But in case you missed the freebies this past week, we sampled four classes that we thought looked interesting. Don&#8217;t worry — it&#8217;s not too late to register, and each class runs throughout the term.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Krav maga</h3>
<p>Krav maga is renowned across the world as the official self-defense combat technique of the Israel Defense Force. Unlike other martial arts available at the Student Rec Centre, krav maga is, strictly speaking, oriented towards self-defense in the purest sense of the word. You can&#8217;t really use it in competition, since the objective of krav maga is to destroy your opponent&#8217;s ability to hurt you as soon as possible — by any means necessary. The eyes and groin are not out-of-bounds territory.</p>
<p>The krav maga course available through UBC REC is an introduction to self-defense in real-life situations. There&#8217;s no talk of honour or internal &#8220;energy,&#8221; nor are students required to wear a gi or learn traditional forms. Instead, you&#8217;ll learn practical techniques, like how to disarm someone armed with a gun or a knife, break a chokehold if you&#8217;re attacked from behind, and generally inflict the largest amount of pain on an opponent in the shortest time possible.</p>
<p>Note that this is not a workout-intensive class; you won&#8217;t lose weight or gain muscle by attending it, since the focus is predominantly on learning. Sessions are fun and accessible to anyone, regardless of gender (there is both a male and female instructor), experience or physical agility.</p>
<p><em>—Rhys Edwards</em></p>
<h3 class="subhead">Cycle Boot Camp</h3>
<p>For shopping week, I decided it would be a good idea to check out the 7 a.m. cycle boot camp. I can&#8217;t quite tell you what I was thinking with that decision.</p>
<p>When I stumbled in, coffee still in hand, everyone else had brought over weights from the dance studio. A girl beside me pointed to the cupboard on my left, and said that since I was late I could just use the weights in there. It was stacked with pink, two-pound weights, the sight of which apparently scared all the men out of the class, since there were none there. Easy, I thought. Ha.</p>
<p>After taking those tiny weights through 40 minutes of bicep, tricep, shoulder, chest and back sets, they felt much larger. I also learned some tips about cycling — possibly obvious, but still things I didn&#8217;t know beforehand. For example, you&#8217;re not supposed to be putting much weight on the handlebars, and it&#8217;s easier on your knees if you keep them in close to the bike. </p>
<p>After 45 minutes in the bike room, we went into the dance studio for the ab set, where we did — ironically — bicycles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend taking it later in the day, but all in all, it&#8217;s a good class. And boys, check it out too. This shit is tough.</p>
<p><em>—Sarah Bigam</em></p>
<h3 class="subhead">Kick-It</h3>
<p>I was up well before sunrise Wednesday morning, and decided to take advantage of Kick-It, one of UBC REC’s free classes during shopping week. With a 7:30 a.m. start, the convenience of having the fitness studio in Ponderosa Commons, my residence, was a plus; the benefit of a three-minute commute and not having to venture outside may inspire my regular attendance.</p>
<p>We were a smaller group of early birds, eight of us, who were led through a martial arts-inspired cardio fitness class. The class accommodated a broad spectrum of experience and abilities. From correct breathing to punching and kicking technique, our instructor put us through our paces.</p>
<p>The hour-long session passed very quickly, and soon we were cooling down and stretching. Upon conclusion, our instructor promised our day would unfold just “a little more smoothly”; indeed, I headed to my 9 a.m. class much more awake than usual, and rode that momentum through my academic day.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I learned that some early-morning exercise trumps even the strongest cup (or three) of coffee, and though we are all busy, there <em>is</em> time in the day to invest in wellness. Find it, commit to it, and smile as you navigate your schedule just “a little more smoothly.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>—Victoria Willes</em></p>
<h3 class="subhead">Mixed martial arts</h3>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to, for lack of a better term, violently drive my hips up into him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Welcome to Dan Slobodin&#8217;s Intro to MMA, the second-to-last class of UBC REC&#8217;s shopping week. </p>
<p>Slobodin has been teaching at UBC REC for four of his six years as a martial arts instructor. He also teaches Brazilian jujitsu at Gracie Barra Vancouver Martial Arts School.</p>
<p>The class began with five minutes of warm-up jogging, shuffling and pushups before moving into basic striking and guard positions. Techniques like &#8220;small packaging&#8221; were demonstrated by Slobodin, and the intro class was a wide variety of basic techniques.</p>
<p>My own mixed martial arts experience is limited to watching Georges St-Pierre, so fortunately for me, my grappling partner, fourth-year kinesiology student Susanna Reid, was one of five other females in the class of 23 students, and roughly my size. </p>
<p>The best way to learn technique is to train with those who are better than you. Still, when Slobodin took over for Reid to demonstrate a shoulder lock submission on me, my heart started racing. Apparently my shoulders are &#8220;more flexible than most people&#8221;, so I tapped out later than normal. Well, that&#8217;s something. </p>
<p>After finishing the class with four minutes of grappling — which seems short until you do it — and stretching, Slobodin had some simple hygiene reminders for the remaining 12 classes. &#8220;Put on deodorant, brush your teeth and clip your fingernails and toenails.&#8221; Those who ignore the rules will be relegated to the corner doing pushups.</p>
<p>Many of the students test-driving the class were sold and headed to the desk to sign up after the packed two hours, while I left with a deep appreciation for the details of mixed martial arts.</p>

<p>AMS President Caroline Wong has dropped out of the race for Board of Governors representative.</p>
<p>Wong said she dropped out to pursue study abroad opportunities, a decision made easier by her confidence in the remaining candidates. </p>
<p>Initially worried about her eligibility for studying abroad after not taking a full course load during her time as president, Wong said she decided to run for BoG rep because, after serving as an AMS executive and now as president, she felt she would make a good student representative.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured I might as well contribute with everything I&#8217;ve learned about the university,&#8221; Wong said.</p>
<p>However, after observing what she considered to be a strong field of candidates, Wong said she had no qualms about bowing out of the race. She said she is continuing to try and study abroad, ideally in Italy.</p>
<p>Wong declined to endorse any of the other BoG reps, saying the AMS executive team had made a collective decision not to endorse candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Hockey: </strong>Successful homestand as both teams earn points</p>
<p>Men&#8217;s hockey showed excellent resolve, coming back from a 3-1 deficit to win 5-3 against St. FX on Friday, Jan. 10. After surrendering three consecutive goals to end the first, the Tigers scored four unanswered goals to finish the game, including two from <strong>Patrick Daley</strong>. On the women&#8217;s side, Dal’s game against Mount Allison on Saturday, Jan. 11 went to three overtime periods to no avail, as<strong> Jeanne Morin</strong> stood on her head for the Tigers, making 29 saves in the 2-2 tie.</p>

<p><strong>Women&#8217;s basketball: </strong>Tigers sweep series to go over .500</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a happy new year for the women&#8217;s basketball team, who rang in 2014 with back-to-back wins in Fredericton. The Tigers began the second half of their season with a 65-55 win on Jan. 10 against UNB, with four players scoring double-digit points. The team followed up their win with an even stronger performance, beating the Varsity Reds by 20 points the next night. Forward <strong>Tessa Stammberger</strong> led the way with a double-double, grabbing 11 rebounds to go along with 18 points.</p>

<p><strong>Men&#8217;s basketball: </strong>Split decision in weekend tilt against UNB</p>
<p>The Tigers looked to get their season on track in Fredericton over the weekend as the team faced the second-place Varsity Reds. After bringing the score to within one at halftime on Saturday night, UNB held on to win 74-66 largely due to Dal&#8217;s nine-point third quarter. Needing a win, the Tigers jumped out to an early lead Sunday and, behind strong performances from <strong>Ritchie Kanza Mata</strong>, <strong>Simon Marr</strong> and<strong> Devon Stedmen</strong>, won 70-65.</p>

<p>When it comes to mountains, Ayat El Dewary has little to expect—she’s never climbed one. But in a few weeks, she’ll be going up the highest mountain in Africa: Mount Kilimanjaro. Her motivation is to help displaced children in Syria.</p>
<p>“It is important for us to understand that what happens to one child affects all children of the world,” El Dewary says over the phone from Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>An Egyptian-Canadian national, El Dewary graduated from Dalhousie in 2004 and is currently an external relations associate at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Abu Dhabi. She is raising funds for the UAE’s Big Heart Campaign in hopes of making a difference in the lives of the children affected by the ongoing Syrian crisis.</p>
<p>“The funds will go towards things such as child protection, as well as providing educational services and shelter. Right now, winter items are very necessary to help them cope with the weather,” El Dewary says.</p>
<p>According to the UN Refugee Agency, there are over 1.1 million Syrian children who are registered as refugees, a result of the Syrian crisis started in 2011. Most of the refugees have fled to neighbouring countries facing conflicts of their own, such as Egypt and Iraq.</p>
<p>A recent report released by the UNHCR says one in 10 Syrian refugee children are working “as breadwinners.” Also, 75 per cent of Syrian refugee children are under 12 years old.</p>
<p>“It’s the worst humanitarian crisis in the 21st century,” says El Dewary.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping others feel the urge to do the same. To be inspired to do something for those children. That generation of children is facing the risk of becoming a lost generation.”</p>
<p>El Dewary is training full-time for her upcoming 10-day expedition, something that requires both mental and physical preparation. Her training involves stair climbing, running, lifting weights and climbing sand dunes.</p>
<p>In her first two weeks, El Dewary managed to raise $6,000, which has since grown to $7,500. She is now hoping to raise the bar of her fundraising goal after a successful start.</p>
<p>“Initially the target was $10,000. But now I want to raise more,” she says.</p>
<p>For her, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity, but El Dewary is hoping that the message behind it will last much longer.</p>
<p>“The main message is to show [Syrian refugees] that they are not alone. Just because they are refugees does not mean that it is a life sentence. The world is going to be there in solidarity.”</p>

(Photo by Bryn Karcha)</p></div>
<p>I hate asking my interview subjects for their names. I’m terrified of spelling an interviewee’s name wrong, so I force myself to ask for the spelling. I hyperventilate even if the subject’s name is an apparently simple Sarah Smith, because she might spell “Sarah” without an “h” at the end, or spell it a way I’ve never seen before. The misspelling of a name is one of the most embarrassing and discreditable practices in journalism.</p>
<p>I always ask for clarification with subjects’ names, but with gender I don’t bother. He’s a boy or she’s a girl—it looks so straightforward, why would I even ask? If I asked a question like, “What’s your preferred pronoun?” I could end up offending a woman who may think I couldn’t tell whether she was a man or a woman.</p>
<p>However, this question of preferred pronoun needs to start being asked—even if there is a risk of possibly offending someone. It’s better for a journalist to ask rather than wrongly assume someone’s pronoun preference. Assuming a pronoun is just as bad as assuming the spelling of a name: it can falsely portray the subject.</p>
<p>With ongoing transgender and transsexual issues to be dealt with, it’s important to get these pronouns right. Though not everyone accepts that gender is not synonymous with sex, nor that “man” and “woman” are the only genders, trans communities are growing and are often portrayed in the media. Journalists must start learning that “they” can be a singular neutral pronoun, or that people who look like men might identify as women, or vice versa.</p>
<p>But it’s easier to agree upon the need to ask subjects for their preferred pronouns than to do it. When I wrote an article for the University of King’s College’s <em>The Watch</em>, I interviewed the Dalhousie libraries’ communications coordinator Marlo MacKay over email. Marlo identifies as woman, but I assumed she was a man due to her first name. Luckily, she corrected my “he” for a “she” before I wrote the article. Had she not corrected me, I could have deeply embarrassed and/or hurt her for mistaking her gender, and thus her identity.</p>
<p>In a King’s journalism course, instructor Lezlie Lowe makes a point of telling students to ask subjects about their preferred pronouns in a class on language and sensitivity. That’s the first step, and I think adding an explanation to the question of why a journalist needs to know the subject’s preferred pronoun for identification accuracy could decrease awkward moments or seemingly rude comments on appearance. <b></b></p>
<p>Following an incidence of mis-gendering in an article earlier this year, the <em>Gazette</em> will be adding gender language criteria to its house style guide because of this growing need for journalists to understand how to respectfully handle transgender and transsexual issues.</p>
<p>If a journalist hasn’t had personal experience wrongly identifying a subject’s gender, or hasn’t been told to ask an interviewee for her preferred pronoun, a journalist would probably—as most people would—assume the subject’s gender from their name or appearance.</p>
<p>The <em>Canadian Press Stylebook</em> mentions that transgender and transsexual people should be referred to by “a term the person in questions uses…and a pronoun consistent with how they live.”<b> </b>Though this explanation encourages the reporter to ensure that transgender and transsexual people have terms and pronouns that represent them, this guideline assumes that the reporter knows the interviewee is transgender or transsexual.</p>
<p>What the <em>Stylebook</em> forgets is that a journalist doesn’t always know, and thus must ask everyone for the terms and pronouns they prefer, even if it seems obvious.</p>

<p>As students at the University of King’s College were returning to school after their winter break, they were met with a nasty surprise.</p>
<p>Pipes in the university’s largest residence, Alexandra Hall, had burst.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Jan. 4, a burst sprinkler drenched the west wing of the building, starting on the fourth floor and seeping down to the ground level.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lee lives in the room next to where the pipe first broke. She arrived at King’s anticipating a smooth return to residence after the holiday, but found her carpeted floor filled with water and all her possessions dampened by the broken pipe.</p>
<p>“We had to pack up all our things. Everything. Even down to posters and things in the drawers.”</p>
<p>By the end of Sunday, 45 students had left King’s and moved into the Lord Nelson Hotel.</p>
<p>“Our things were put into storage and by the end of the afternoon I was settled at the Lord Nelson,” says Lee.</p>
<p>Nick Hatt, King&#8217;s dean of residence, said he was very happy with the reaction of the staff and students to such a dramatic arrival back to campus.</p>
<p>“The students have been very positive and understanding and have been helping out one another quite a lot. The staff have pulled together very well and are working tirelessly, with good cheer.”</p>
<p>At this point, students still don&#8217;t know when they will be able to return to residence, but  estimates range from two to three weeks from when they were initially displaced.</p>
<p>The west wing of Alex Hall is under renovation as a result. Large orange tarps block the area from student access and the sound of hammers and drills echoes down the long hallways.</p>
<p>The King’s chapel, which also flooded due to a broken pipe, is undergoing repairs as well. The water damaged many of the historic texts and artifacts stored in the chapel but efforts are being made to ensure they are properly restored.</p>
<p>Despite the nuisance of locking many of their possessions in storage, facing a sudden commute to school and not knowing when they will be able to return to their residence rooms, these uprooted King&#8217;s students have kept positive.</p>
<p>“Now I don’t have to shower with flip-flops on,” says Lee, “and there’s two-ply toilet paper so hey, that’s an added bonus.”</p>
<p><i>Editor&#8217;s note: Eleanor Davidson lives in the fourth-floor of Alexandra Hall. Her room was not damaged.</i></p>

<p>Alanna Griffin and Karen Gross know that a career in the arts requires ingenuity and creativity for survival. The two Dalhousie and King’s honours students in theatre have taken the future into their own hands and organized the stART festival, a multi-institutional interdisciplinary arts showcase featuring spoken word, theatre, visual and literary art pieces premiering at the Bus Stop Theatre in March.</p>
<p>“It is different than in other jobs,” Gross says of involvement with theatre. “The arts are more niche…that’s just the reality of an arts career: [it's] self-regulating.”</p>
<p>To be successful in the arts requires self-driven work, so the opportunities to engage can seem limited.</p>
<p>“But the opportunity exists still,” says Griffin.</p>
<p>The two coordinators are working to provide more opportunity for students in Halifax to engage with their future careers through mentors at the festival.  For Griffin and Gross, stART attempts to bridge the gap between the theoretical education that university provides and the practical nature of careers in order to help students with the transition from education to workplace.  Both have an understanding that transitioning from student to professional will require more experience than what is covered in their education, suggesting that “practical experience certainly is the limiting factor in any artisan’s career.”</p>
<p>While working at a career counselling center, Griffin was inspired by the need to seek “mentorship as your own initiative.”</p>
<p>The two coordinators are attempting to help students emerging as professionals in Halifax take this initiative, and bridge the gap between university and work.   They hope to “foster an infrastructure of transition” in the artistic community in Halifax.  After all, the two fourth-years recognize that “this is our start, too.”</p>
<p>While it was challenging for Griffin and Gross to get word around about the festival, they hope that their networking will help to establish some infrastructure for communication between students and professionals in the future.  The founders hope to expand stART across Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>A fundraising preview event for stART featuring the talents of artist Mitchell Wiebe, director Mary Vingoe, and many more professionals will take place at the Bus Stop Theatre on Friday, Jan. 17 at 8pm. Post-secondary artists can find submission information by e-mailing startfesthalifax@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Simone Schmidt sat alone as her boyfriend went through a tiring day of chemotherapy. She had to stop being an anti-poverty organizer and shift her focus to take care of him, but never imagined it would be so difficult, or that she would feel so old doing it. On her boyfriend’s rougher days, Schmidt began journaling as characters she created or based on real people, writing out their feelings as sound poetry. On his good days, her boyfriend helped Schmidt create melodies to convert the characters and their stories into songs.</p>
<p>“Through the illness of my boyfriend I came to love to play guitar because it was a way to feel young,” she says.</p>
<p>Schmidt, of One Hundred Dollars and The Highest Order, released her debut solo album, <em>Lost the Plot</em>, this past September under the name FIVER. The songs on the album are about care-giving, sickness and infection.</p>
<p>Schmidt was disappointed with the media’s portrayal of the cancer patient always coming out a stronger person, which she found isn’t usually the case (though her boyfriend is currently in remission). She also noticed that the media barely ever focused on the struggle of the caregiver, particularly young female ones, who often feel guilty when caring for a boyfriend, when the relationship doesn’t survive the chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The songs on <em>Lost the Plot</em> are rooted in the narrative folk tradition, but Schmidt added a layer of psychedelic sound.</p>
<p>The last song on the album, “Undertaker” explores the story of a WWE wrestler. The Undertaker and his brother blame each other for burning down their parents’ house/funeral home (their father was a mortician). The Undertaker’s brother is accused of arson and committed to an asylum, but it hasn’t been resolved as to who committed the crime.</p>
<p>“In song-writing, I’m always trying to build an empathy between the speaker in the song and the listener,” Schmidt says. “Whether or not the speaker is someone I agree with is in the question of whether or not I can feel the challenge in their life.”</p>
<p>Schmidt created another layer of the song by using wordplay to expand on The Undertaker as a man who struggles with love because he takes less than he himself undertakes from others.</p>
<p>With Schmidt having total creative and production control over <em>Lost the Plot</em>, she created the album for vinyl. Her music is quieter than the average mp3 or CD album because she wants the listener to turn up the volume on the record player to hear new things on the album, as necessary for most records.</p>
<p>“I do feel like the point of the record is to have the intention to spend time with it,” she said, “not to just fill your playlist with some cool blip in your time.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2014 is upon us, and now that the dust has cleared, we can reflect on some of the great things the past year brought us.  If you’re like me, the first thing you thought of was, “What was the best album of 2013?” Thankfully, critics did all the thinking for us. According to many publications the answer was obvious: <em>Yeezus</em>, from mainstream hip-hop’s Lord and Saviour (Kanye West).  Other popular critic picks were Vampire Weekend, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire with either Lorde, Haim, Chance the Rapper or Disclosure in a fifth place slot.</p>
<p>While these are all fun, well-made recordings, if every critic picked Kanye as their number one, it would make for a dull conclusion to 2013. Thankfully, a few publications changed it up, bringing more attention to other great releases of the past year. So, below are five of the best “Best albums of 2013” lists:</p>
<p><strong> 5)</strong> <em><strong>Coke Machine Glow</strong></em></p>
<p>What first caught my eye about webzine <em>Coke Machine Glow</em>’s list is that they made a point of NOT putting Vampire Weekend, Daft Punk or Kanye on their list. But why should they? It isn’t their style, and it’s all been said already. And to top off their (refreshingly) short list? Frog Eye’s <em>Carey’s Cold Spring</em>. I’ve never heard of it either, but it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>4) <em>Gorilla vs. Bear</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Gorilla vs. Bear</em>’s 40-album list is thankfully just that—albums. No snobiness or buzzwords, just titles, artwork and a track via Soundcloud.  Their top pick was the awesome R&amp;B release <em>Anxiety</em> from Autre Ne Veut, and they even included <em>After Dark 2</em>, a Neo-80s compilation from label Italians Do It Better. If you’re a <em>Drive</em> fan, you’ll be glad they remembered it.</p>
<p><strong>3) <em>Tiny Mix Tapes</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Tiny Mix Tapes</em> know what they like and that’s exactly what they gave you. With a list of ambient, experimental and electronic releases, it’s a list that is proudly true to themselves. If you’re a fan of these genres or their site, you’ll be happy to see that Oneohtrix Point Never’s <em>R Plus Seven</em> made it to the top—and probably to the top of your list as well.</p>
<p><strong>2) <em>The Needle Drop</em></strong><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Anthony Fantano (aka <em>The Needle Drop</em>) had a much fan-anticipated list, and if you know his work, it’s easy to see why. His video list has personality, and you’ll be entertained by how many adjectives he uses to describe 50 albums. He shares a bit of everything, from J-Pop to black metal, and it feels genuine. Thanks Fantano.</p>
<p>1) <em>Fact Mag</em></p>
<p>Tired of the nitpicking, <em>Fact Mag</em> decided it’s time for a change. Instead of worrying about formats or formalities, <em>Fact</em> had the attitude of “if it’s good, it’s on the list.” This gave us a grab bag of everything, from cassette releases to the almighty <em>Yeezus</em>. What’s not to love about that? Besides being good sports, their list had fun albums, weird albums, albums I’ve never heard of and Miley Cyrus’ <em>Bangerz</em>. Now that’s a way to conclude 2013.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political arena is a public relations free-for-all. In a realm notorious for slinging more than mud, it is hard to recognize philosophers from sophists, heroes from hell-raisers and fast-talkers with hidden agendas. Still, if you hold your nose and hose down the scene from time to time, there are many elected officials doing solid work; there is even one on Prime Minister Harper’s staff, a dark horse I did not expect. I used to think that being locked in Harper’s cabinet would feel like the interior of an iron maiden, but John Baird is making me think twice.</p>
<p>Notorious for being a Conservative Party pit bull, he has made his opinion ring loud and clear in the House of Commons since his 2006 debut. During Stéphane Dion’s attacks on the environmental policies of Harper’s minority government, Baird’s brutal taunts even threatened the composure of the most even-tempered opponents. In 2009, the <em>Toronto Star</em> called him <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2009/08/01/pit_bull_john_baird_bred_for_political_life.html" target="_blank">“a complicated man,”</a> equal parts attack dog and vegetarian.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2011. John Baird is now the minister of Foreign Affairs under a Conservative majority government, a position in which his provocative approach may be ill-advised. I cringed at his <em>Globe and Mail</em> article a few months after the solid election win: <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/john-baird-crafts-canadian-foreign-policy-with-a-hard-edge/article1357176/" target="_blank">“Stephen Harper said it and I’ve said it: ‘We don’t just go along to get along.’”</a> I dismissed this buffoon and his tough talk as more ham-handed international relations from a government who seeks to negotiate more than connect. I have to admit I was wrong.</p>
<p>When my grandfather brought up John Baird as an example of an effective politician recently, he gained my full attention. My grandfather is a gentle man with no time for nonsense and shouting, and I could not believe that John Baird had his approval. I had stopped listening to the guy two years too soon it seems—he is being named Policymaker of the Year by the MacDonald-Laurier Institute’s Inside Policy magazine. Continuing my Google hunt, I see an article from the <em>National Post</em>: <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/08/01/john-baird-blasts-russias-hateful-anti-gay-law-after-pushing-privately-for-change/" target="_blank">“John Baird blasts Russia’s ‘hateful’ anti-gay law, after pushing privately for change.”</a> In the article, the ‘blast’ was articulate and diplomatic, pushing off from a question about the Sochi 2014 Olympics. ““This mean-spirited and hateful law will affect all Russians 365 days of the year, every year. It is an incitement to intolerance, which breeds hate. And intolerance and hate breed violence.””</p>
<p>And I think: where did this guy come from?</p>
<p>Baird’s dogged support and blustery counterattacks have earned him leeway to grow over time, and while his teeth are sharper than ever, he seems more careful in picking his battles and planning ahead to fight them on his terms. The secret power of his stern stance is that it has remained consistent, something of a blessing in turbulent international times. Baird has done good work to rekindle Canada’s reputation as a highly principled nation, an identity fitting of deep values of freedom.</p>
<p>Many claim we live in an inundation of information, and it does not surprise me that this subtle shift in Baird had to be pointed out to me in order for me to take notice. Still, I can’t let myself off the hook for making assumptions about him. I deride him for his harsh hyperboles, crude tactics and for the company he keeps and endorses at all costs, but I let this blind me to his policy actions that outshone those of his predecessors in foreign affairs. I think he has earned his title as Canadian Policymaker of the Year.</p>
<p>Do I like everything the guy has to say? No. Do I support Stephen Harper? Heck no. Nevertheless, Baird is no longer so easy to dismiss as rash and oppositional. The question remains: is Baird becoming a good leader, or is Harper simply a good puppet master? I can’t decide if it’s Baird or beard, but I am willing to listen to him now, and he makes me wonder who else I may have wrongly dismissed.</p>

<p>As new strains of influenza appear across the globe, Dalhousie is staying ahead of the game. The university is collaborating on a long-term influenza research project with the University of Saskatchewan. Dal president Richard Florizone, former vice-president finance and resources at the Saskatoon university, announced a partnership with his former employer Jan. 6 over Twitter.</p>
<p>While flu research is nothing new at Dalhousie, this partnership will set the stage for research efforts at a national level. Scott Halperin, professor of immunology, pediatrics and microbiology at Dal, is leading the project. Halperin also heads the department of infectious diseases at the IWK and is the director of the Canadian Center for Vaccinology.</p>

<p><strong>Students Nova Scotia launch new campaign</strong><br />
<em>by Jesse Ward, assistant news editor</em></p>
<p>Students Nova Scotia (SNS) is asking post-secondary students in Nova Scotia to voice their opinions on student debt.</p>
<p>A petition to Nova Scotia’s MLAs and the hashtag #StudentsSpeakOut are at the forefront of the advocacy group’s new Students Speak Out campaign.</p>
<p>The petition asks the provincial government to adopt three policies they have drafted.</p>
<p>The requests are to freeze tuition at zero per cent growth until youth employment outcomes recover, improve the Nova Scotia Student Assistance Program and give students the power to choose whether new ancillary fees are approved for non-academic services.<br />
As of press time, the petition—“Province of Nova Scotia: Act on post-secondary education affordability and youth retention and attraction”—has attracted 104 supporters.</p>
<p>More information on the campaign and a link to the petition may be found at <a href="www.studentsspeakout.ca" target="_blank">www.studentsspeakout.ca</a>.</p>

<p>The women&#8217;s volleyball team emerged with consecutive victories in their weekend series against Memorial. However, it was a tale of two starkly different matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t very good today,&#8221; said head coach Rick Scott following Sunday&#8217;s grueling 3-1 victory. &#8220;Give Memorial credit. They came out to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Tigers opened the weekend series Saturday evening in a manner befitting the defending Atlantic University Sport (AUS) champions, handling the Sea-Hawks in a straight sets victory. It was another commanding win, with 10 kills from Anna Dunn and nine digs from Marisa Mota, while Katherine Ryan added seven kills and eight digs.</p>
<p>Memorial regrouped Sunday, putting the pressure on the Tigers early in the first set. &#8220;They were hungrier, they played better,&#8221; said Scott.</p>
<p>After separate runs of five and six consecutive points, the Sea-Hawks kept the Tigers at arm&#8217;s length to win the set 25-17.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came out a little slow, but definitely worked hard and came back,&#8221; said setter Brett Hastings, who came off the bench and played for long stretches throughout the match.</p>
<p>Unforced errors and dropped balls nearly spelled further defeat for the Tigers. A strong offensive start in the second set held off a late Memorial comeback to win the second set 25-18.</p>
<p>&#8220;[You have] to credit our girls for being resilient, finding a way to win it,&#8221; said Scott, whose team currently sits in first place, just ahead of rival Saint Mary&#8217;s.</p>
<div id="attachment_18559" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://dalgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rsz_wvball_kitmoran.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18559" alt="Jessica Josenhans, 10, defends the net.

(Photo by Kit Moran)</p></div>
<p>From his usual stance on the sideline, Scott appeared to be a &#8220;seventh man&#8221; as Dal rallied in the third set from being down 6-15 to eventually bring it within two points. &#8220;We&#8217;re in a battle,&#8221; exhorted Scott from the huddle during a timeout.</p>
<p>The match reached a critical juncture when the flag judge called a potentially game changing point in for Memorial, but was overruled by the chair official, giving the point to Dal, who went on to win 26-24.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great comeback,&#8221; said Scott on their third set. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing magical. Just hard work and attention to detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Tigers’ resiliency was on further display against a strong Memorial side in the fourth set, with the two teams trading points from the technical timeout onward. In the end, Dal outlasted the Sea-Hawks 25-23 to win the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our serve receive definitely stepped up and our defense fought through,&#8221; said the second year Hastings, who was awarded player of the game.</p>
<p>Despite the team&#8217;s shortcomings, matches like Sunday’s serve a purpose for Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;[It's] really important, to find ways to win when you&#8217;re not playing well. We did that today&#8221;</p>

According to the Syrian state-run news agency SANA, Assad is ready to participate in the Jan. 22 peace talks termed Geneva II. Unfortunately, it is likely that these talks will have little effect on ending the devastating civil war. Part of Assad’s message, relayed to the Pope’s secretary of state, Archbishop Pietro Parolin, by Syrian Minister of State Joseph Sweid, reportedly contained a pointed reprimand for other nations involved in the civil war: outside countries must stop supporting “terrorist groups.” Instead, the Syrian president’s message argued, peace could only come through a national dialogue among Syrians, under Syrian leadership, without foreign intervention. Although this claim seems reasonable on its surface, the Assad government is hardly trustworthy in the eyes of many when it comes to democratic reforms. Assad, once considered a hopeful candidate for liberalizing his nation (when the untimely death of his brother forced the one-time ophthalmologist into the limelight of political affairs he had previously eschewed), has now overseen the deaths of what current estimates put at 130 000 of his countrymen. The issue revolves around the role of Assad in any future government. Western nations like Great Britain and the United States have unabashedly called for his removal. U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague argued that, “President Assad has no role in a peaceful and democratic Syria”—indeed, he hardly seems deserving of one.  But this is scarcely a proposal Assad’s government is likely to accept, especially when it perceives that victory is still within its grasp. Complicating conflict The Syrian government has continued to wage an effective war against rebel opposition groups, making use of military and economic aid from Iran and Russia, its two main allies in the conflict. Although opposition groups are supported by a number of Western and allied Gulf nations—termed the “Friends of Syria”—internal divisions between rebel groups have prevented any strong, single centralized leadership from arising. This is hardly surprising, given that the rebel groups have fractured into two very different categories. When the Civil War initially grew out of the protests that the so-called Arab Spring of early 2011 had helped foster, the war was fought by dissident civilians and defected army units unhappy with orders to attack unarmed protestors. However, the last year has seen many of these groups give way to increasingly violent Islamic extremist groups, the majority of whom are not Syrian. The Free Syrian Army, initially composed almost entirely of Syrians, now has a large portion of extremist rebels with ties to groups that Western backers find politically unpalatable. In September, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry estimated that extremists formed 25 per cent of all rebel forces and that 12 per cent were linked to al-Qaeda. The al-Nusra Front, which is in itself roughly 25 per cent of the opposition forces, draws fighters from all over the Middle East, including Libya, following the end of the American-backed Civil War there. The problem with so many foreign fighters in Syria is that they bring an extensive level of sectarianism to the violence. Assad, though his government is stoutly secular, is himself a member of the Alawite minority, which is an offshoot of Shia, and has sworn to protect his nation and its citizens “against the crimes committed by the takfiri [Sunni Muslim extremes].” Rebel forces are mainly Sunni, as are the majority of Syrian citizens. Many rebels see themselves engaging in a holy jihad to protect their religiously aligned brethren. This is equally a problem for the United States, as it struggles against Islamic extremists in Iraq and Afghanistan. Supporting groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISS) is difficult to justify to the electorate back home, when those groups openly trumpet their desire for the imposition of Sharia law. Such declarations appeal within the strongly Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has become the main backer of Syrian rebel groups. American voters, however, can no doubt be excused for their understandable confusion over their government’s support for groups that seem so suspiciously similar to the enemy of other battlefields. And this is the problem with Assad’s declaration to the Pope. Of course he will meet to discuss terms, if, in the impossible hypothetical, all foreign-supported groups could be removed from Syria. With fights breaking out now between moderate and extremist opposition groups as well as the national army, there will not be much left in Syria for the president to consider a prize, should the violence continue apace. And an opposition entirely deprived of foreign aid would likely be far easier to defeat. However, Assad must know that, as a demand, this is hardly likely to be met, especially if those opposition groups he wants expelled are to have a place at the peace talks. A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun So long as Assad remains in a position where he feels he can comfortably endure the civil war, he is unlikely to embrace peace. As long as Assad continues to bring about the merciless slaughter of thousands of civilians, foreign fighters, especially fellow Sunnis from neighbouring countries, are unlikely to embrace peace either. And, as long as Syria continues to be a hotly contested and heavily armed, roiling pot of open warfare, western nations are unlikely to fully commit the aid or arms necessary to bring the war to a halt. And so it seems likely that the Pope’s pleas for peace will go unfulfilled, at least for the time being. But in many ways, it has allowed Assad to speak truths that will ultimately be recognized in time: true and lasting peace must come through the ballot box, and Syrians must be allowed to determine their own futures. These are not new or novel sentiments, but they are, in a way, as strong a set of indictments against the Western powers as they are against Iran and Saudi Arabia. Ultimately, hammering away at the bargaining table for the removal of chemical weapons seems a hollow gesture when, at the same time, other branches of those same governments export conventional arms en masse to the same theatre.

Sarah Piller, who spotted Frendt’s fall, rushed to his aid. “You can’t just let something like that happen and not act,” stated Piller. “Sometimes you just have to run over and Instagram it.” Unfortunately, due to Piller’s preoccupation with her phone, she was unable to help him. “I am not a doctor anyway,” stated Piller. “The only thing I could do to help was yell, ‘Is anyone here a doctor?’ in hopes that someone would hear and help him, allowing me to videotape the event.” According to witnesses, Piller’s cries for help were quickly followed by the apparition of a big, blue British police box, right beside Piller and Frendt. “It was like the world had split apart for just a second,” Frendt stated. “I wasn’t sure if I was hallucinating, until I realized that Sarah heard the crack and saw the box too.” A man, approximately five foot nine inches in height, quickly stepped out of the blue police box. According to witnesses, he  wore a tweed jacket with elbow patches and a bow tie. The man from the box loudly stated that he was a doctor. Despite the extremely odd entrance, Piller was not worried. “When he stated that he was a doctor, I was so relieved, as my battery was about to die,” stated Piller. Although the man claimed he was a doctor, he didn’t do much healing, according to Piller. “He just stood around talking about space and time,” stated Piller. Frendt, although in a lot of pain and slightly delusional, was able to remember the interaction he had with the mysterious doctor. “He [the doctor] started to point what he called a ‘screwdriver’ towards me, stating it would fix me. Sarah then started yelling, ‘He’s not a machine! You can’t fix a person with a screwdriver!’” states Frendt. “It was all very confusing.” After reports of increasingly loud interactions between Piller and the mysterious doctor, the police arrived to investigate noise disturbance. Upon surveying the scene, the police brought the unnamed man in for questioning and called for an ambulance. Police questioning of the mysterious man was unsuccessful.

An amazingly good safety record, and that’s true.

The crew of scientists aboard the JOIDES Resolution, a large ocean drilling boat, consisted of 34 people from universities in 12 different countries. Gillis and Jonathan Snow, from the University of Houston, were the two chief scientists. Expedition 345, as it is officially named by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), took place at the Hess Deep Rift. The rift is located 900 kilometres west of the Galapagos Islands. “There are very few places in the world,” says Gillis, “where the geology has exposed deep rocks more than four kilometres below the sea floor and on the sea floor, if that makes sense.” She goes on to explain, “In this area of Hess Deep, plate tectonics have formed a deep rift valley, and if you were to go down in a submersible, along the walls of this rift, you see the upper four kilometres of the ocean’s crust exposed.” It is a very unique place, because these deep rocks are exposed on the ocean floor. Deep rifts such as this are considered a fast-spreading ridge, and they are responsible for forming three quarters of the ocean floor. Gillis has been with the IODP for over 20 years and, in that time, has been majorly involved with two expeditions. “The other one was 20 years ago in the same location,” says Gillis, “but with different objectives. We were still drilling into the ocean crust but at a different level within the crust.” The ocean’s crust is made up of layers. Gillis says the rocks collected “tell us a lot about how the ocean’s crust gets built.” It’s made up of a top layer of lavas and sediment, a layer of a basaltic sheeted dike (sheets of volcanic rock), and then a layer of gabbro. Gabbro is magma that has cooled under the earth’s crust. Although it starts out as magma, like the basalt, it is noticeably different from the layer that covers it. Because of how it cools under the earth’s crust, it forms small crystals. The Hess Deep Rift is special because it has sections that have direct access to the gabbro layer and the ophiolites that make it up. They were able to drill into this layer thanks to the IODP. Now back at UVic, Gillis says, “The next thing for me is not to go back on the ship, but to go back with new eyes to these ophiolites, and that’s what I plan to do next year when I’m on my sabbatical.”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2562:"During a two-month expedition on the JOIDES Resolution, Dr. Kathy Gillis, associate dean of the Faculty of Science at UVic, was one of two chief scientists that helped confirm and refine hypotheses about how the ocean crust was formed.

The U-Pass system was originally implemented through a student referendum in 1999. The U-Pass allows students to use their student card as a bus pass on B.C. Transit after paying a fee of $81 per term, which is included in student fees. The $81 fee for a four-month period offers significant savings over the B.C. Transit price of $85 for a single-month pass for a student. Since the implementation of the program, staff have re-encoded U-Passes each term at one of three locations: the Grad Centre, the UVSS info booth in the SUB, and the photo ID centre in University Centre. But now, two automated machines have been placed in the University Centre and a third will soon operate in the SUB, once its faulty motherboard is replaced. Director of Campus Services Jim Forbes says, “As opposed to going into a line-up when it’s fairly busy, now people are able to go anytime to any of the three kiosks and insert their card and have it done by the kiosk. So it’s re-encoded for U-Pass privileges on the spot.” Students may activate their U-Pass anytime the buildings that contain the machines are accessible, and it takes seconds to accomplish. Forbes says they tried to place the machines in central areas. “It’s really about the effect on the student, that they don’t have to line up to go get their card re-encoded . . . I think it’s a better service level certainly.” Forbes will bring in extra machines if there is a demand for them. Presently, however, he feels that they have determined the correct number and that no more than the three will be required. The new kiosks are considered a low-cost solution to the problem of lineups. The university saves money by reducing labour hours which would previously have been spent re-encoding cards. Forbes says, “We were hiring people to manage re-encoding cards, and we just thought, as opposed to spending $5 000 to $7 000 a year re-encoding cards with a staff member, we can probably develop one-time technology to eliminate that cost. So over the course of our discussions with B.C. Transit, they were also very supportive of anything that makes the U-Pass a better experience for the student at the end of the day. So, to that end, they helped support us financially in terms of developing the technology. It’s going extremely well so far. The three kiosks cost $40 000, with B.C. Transit contributing between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the costs.” The kiosks aren’t the only technological addition made on campus recently that Forbes has been involved with. An app available for free download under the name UVic Mobile was introduced six months ago. The app includes many student-friendly elements, such as allowing students to see the next three buses that are leaving campus, the specials of the day at various eateries on campus, and emergency alerts. It is also tied in to campus security. According to Forbes, about 3 000 students have signed up for the app. “It’s great for a student to be able to come out of exams or a class at 9:30 at night and know within six minutes that they should make their way to the bus stop or that the bus is not coming for half an hour so they have an extra 20 minutes to study,” says Forbes. “So again, all of these things are contributing to the student experience.”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"content";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3491:"UVic is seeking to save labour costs and cut down on lineups at the beginning of semesters by bringing in automated kiosks for students to activate their public transit service.

So over the course of our discussions with B.C. Transit, they were also very supportive of anything that makes the U-Pass a better experience for the student at the end of the day. So, to that end, they helped support us financially in terms of developing the technology. It’s going extremely well so far. The three kiosks cost $40 000, with B.C. Transit contributing between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the costs.” The kiosks aren’t the only technological addition made on campus recently that Forbes has been involved with. An app available for free download under the name UVic Mobile was introduced six months ago. The app includes many student-friendly elements, such as allowing students to see the next three buses that are leaving campus, the specials of the day at various eateries on campus, and emergency alerts. It is also tied in to campus security. According to Forbes, about 3 000 students have signed up for the app. “It’s great for a student to be able to come out of exams or a class at 9:30 at night and know within six minutes that they should make their way to the bus stop or that the bus is not coming for half an hour so they have an extra 20 minutes to study,” says Forbes. “So again, all of these things are contributing to the student experience.”";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:67;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"

			<h3>After over 15 years in the Hall Building, Java U is set to be replaced in the spring with a student food co-operative. </h3>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

The problem, management says, is that they still haven’t been told directly that decision is final, and are still expected to pay $20,000 for renovations to the bathrooms Java U shares with Reggie’s bar.</p>

	<p>The café has leased the space from CUSAcorp—the for-profit arm of the Concordia Student Union—since 1998, but will be replaced by a student-run co-op after undergraduates voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal in a November referendum.</p>

	<p>“[CUSAcorp said last November] they would probably not renew the lease after May,” Java U franchise manager Jace Li said. “But it was us that asked [CUSAcorp] for the update because they had not told us anything.”</p>

	<p>In fact, Li says she only heard <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp would be replacing the Java U with a student-run co-op after reading about it in <em>The Link</em> two weeks ago.</p>

	<p>But <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp President Scott Carr says it’s “unfair to say there is no dialogue” between <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp and Java U.</p>

	<p>In late August, <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp met with the location owners and Java U head office to let them know about the possibility the franchise’s lease would not be renewed.</p>

	<p>“The contract that we have is clear and we do not feel the need to be opening a dialogue with them on an ongoing basis about their current lease agreement,” said <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp chairperson James Tyler Vaccaro. </p>

	<p>“We both know the obligations of both parties for it and we know the end date for it.” </p>

	<p><span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp was bound by <span class="caps">CSU</span> council in a vote on Jan. 8 not to renew Java U’s lease, cementing the mandate established by the November referendum requiring <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp to help establish a student-run lessee in the space. </p>

	<p>A financial needs assessment is being completed by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp to evaluate the viability of installing different kinds of student-run co-op business models in the space. The report will be presented to <span class="caps">CSU</span> council in February.</p>

	<p><strong>Taking up Space</strong></p>

	<p>Java U was founded by Asher Adler, a Concordia graduate, and Ron Mofford in 1996. Their flagship location—still open today—is at the corner of de Maisonneuve Blvd. W. and Guy St. Thirty locations are now open worldwide, including in Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, but the company’s very first expansion was into the Hall Building mezzanine.</p>

	<p>The current lease between Java U and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp sees the café pay about $7,500 per month in rent, according to Li. Carr—also the <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Finance—could not confirm how much the café pays in rent because that information may be confidential.</p>

	<p>A student-run initiative is expected to lease the space for free, but no business models have been approved so far. Services and financial feasibility reports from a <span class="caps">CSU</span> committee and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp respectively are being presented to <span class="caps">CSU</span> council in February.</p>

	<p>Requests for proposals for the space are due Feb. 24.</p>

	<p>According to Li, Java U is also responsible for paying for a quarter of the construction costs for any of the space shared between the café and the student-run bar Reggie’s, which is currently closed for renovations.</p>

	<p>Li says Java U was told they would be responsible for paying 25 per cent of the $80,000 total cost of renovating the shared bathrooms, which she says is unfair considering they’re being forced to vacate the space.</p>

	<p>Carr says the contract is quite clear on Java U’s financial responsibility for the bathroom space, adding that Java U is essentially paying for the damages incurred over their time in the mezzanine space.</p>

	<p>“If the construction occurs before they are removed, then yes, the contract allows us to charge them,” he said. </p>

	<p>“Because they’ve been around for so many years and they got the chance to use the bathrooms so much, you can throw it back and say the value of the bathroom has gone down over time because of so much use, and although they may not reap the benefits of a brand new bathroom they also reaped the benefits of a bathroom continuously being used.”</p>

	<p><strong>A Place of Our Own</strong></p>

	<p>Hayley-Jean Lochner is a final-year creative writing student at Concordia. She says she regularly buys coffee from the mezzanine Java U location primarily because of its proximity to her classes.</p>

	<p>“It’s out of convenience [I go there]; it’s at the bottom of the escalator and it’s certainly not cheaper than other coffee places around […]. As a space it’s also not particularly inviting,” she said.</p>

	<p>Geography graduate student William Zullo says he also frequents the campus café out of convenience, adding that the popularity of cafés around the downtown campus keep Java U from getting too busy or crowded.</p>

	<p>However, both Lochner and Zullo say they wouldn’t be against replacing the Java U with a student-run café.</p>

	<p>“It’d be very interesting to see if things change if a student co-op was put in there,” Lochner said.</p>

	<p>“It would make a big difference. If it was a student co-op I would go out of my way to go there,” she added—with one caveat: more affordable food.</p>

	<p>As for Li, who says prices are as low as they can be considering the amount they spend on their cuts of meat and chicken, she says a student-run café can be profitable only with good management.</p>

	<p>“I mean an actual manager, not a student doing the job. Students are busy with school and I know they need experience working as a manager but a manager is really important; they need to be in control,” she said. </p>

	<p>“Whether a business makes money or not comes down to the manager. They need to do a good job.” </p>

			<p>While the Concordia Student Union is no stranger to arguing among its members, last Wednesday’s special council meeting set a new standard for infighting for this year’s crop of executives and councillors.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The argument in question stemmed from a motion that would’ve seen an assessment of the CSU’s finances done to determine the funding available for a student-run food co-operative to replace the Java U café located on the Hall Building’s mezzanine. Problems arose when deciding who would oversee the project.</p>

	<p>An amendment to task <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Finance Scott Carr with overseeing the assessment was challenged by VP Sustainability Ben Prunty, who told council he wanted <span class="caps">CSU</span> General Manager Robert Henri in charge of the undertaking in order to quash any potential bias.</p>

	<p>“To be clear, the [motion without my amendment] could have easily been used as an excuse to exclude necessary interested parties from the legal deliberations, and very plausibly this would have been to the detriment of the democratic process,” Prunty told <em>The Link</em> in an email on Monday.</p>

	<p>According to Prunty, keeping things in the hands of the GM—who answers only to the <span class="caps">CSU</span> president—will limit any bias against a co-op initiative in the Java U space.</p>

	<p>The co-op initiative has faced its share of opposition and criticism since it began as a petition last semester. The results of an October referendum where students voted on whether to support the creation of a co-op—which passed overwhelmingly with about 80 per cent support—was challenged by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp, the CSU’s for-profit arm, which manages and leases the Java U space.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> Judicial Board voted in November that the results of referenda were binding and that <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp can be directed by the <span class="caps">CSU</span> towards a unilateral decision.<br />
Last week’s special council meeting saw the CSU’s referendum oversight committee present recommendations for establishing the food co-operative, prompting the motion for the financial needs assessment.</p>

	<p>Prunty objected to having Carr—also the president of CUSAcorp—in charge of the assessment, which multiple members of council called an “insult” to Carr.</p>

	<p>“It kinda makes sense to get the VP Finance to write a financial assessment,” wrote Carr over Twitter. “Not going to lie, but kinda insulting.”</p>

	<p><strong>Executive Conflict</strong></p>

	<p>Prunty maintains his amendment was only to ensure the <span class="caps">CSU</span> followed through on the mandate given to them by students.</p>

	<p>“As one of the only people at council to have sat through both of the <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp Board’s […] attempts to subvert the successful petition process despite the fact that it was 100 per cent in keeping with the CSU’s bylaws […] I am very aware of just how far biases can manifest themselves in legal matters when dealing with this question specifically,” said Prunty.</p>

 “I have been the informal primary contact point between the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and the petitioners and I’ve alerted the petitioners in the past, and will continue to alert them as well as the rest of the student body when the democratic process is not being respected as fully as it needs to be,” he continued. 

	<p>“Good governance is paramount to a functioning student union.” But Carr also has his share of criticism for Prunty.</p>

	<p>“I think the suggestions brought forward by Mr. Prunty were without foundation,” said Carr. </p>

	<p>“His arguments were unsubstantial but more importantly unprofessional. I’m here to do a job and I think that the uproar that we saw at council, who came to my defense, is a clear sign that they are satisfied with not only the quality of my work to date but the integrity,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“I just hope that Mr. Prunty will start acting like this is a professional institution.”</p>

	<p><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></p>

	<p>With its members divided and no end in sight to the volatile deliberations, the entire motion was tabled to the February general council meeting. <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp is also set to present its report on possible financial options for the student-run business.</p>

	<p>Beyond the creation of a financial needs assessment, the motion called for the union to adopt a “collaborative direct implementation” model to breathe life into the co-op. The model links the referendum oversight committee and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp along with interested parties in establishing a business plan for the co-operative.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> will also be consulting its lawyers to determine what money is available for funding the co-op.</p>

	<p>The union is looking to determine if they are able to use money from the student space fund, which holds millions of dollars the union has collected for the last decade to someday purchase a student centre. Undergraduates currently pay $1.50 per credit into the fund.</p>

	<p>Despite the conflict, <span class="caps">CSU</span> President Melissa Kate Wheeler says the union is set on fulfilling the mandate given to it by students to open the co-op.<br />
“Disagreements, especially over something this complex and important, are a natural part of decision-making,” she said.</p>

	<p>“We, as representatives of a larger body, are, and should continue to be focused on creating plans which are sustainable, cost-efficient and in keeping with the mandates we receive from our members,” she added. </p>

	<p>“Sometimes this results in conflict, but that isn’t the point. The point is that we’re moving it forward and fulfilling a mandate given to us directly by members of the <span class="caps">CSU</span>.”</p>

	<p>“I just hope that Mr. Prunty will start acting like this is a professional institution.”</p>

	<p><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></p>

	<p>With its members divided and no end in sight to the volatile deliberations, the entire motion was tabled to the February general council meeting. <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp is also set to present its report on possible financial options for the student-run business.</p>

	<p>Beyond the creation of a financial needs assessment, the motion called for the union to adopt a “collaborative direct implementation” model to breathe life into the co-op. The model links the referendum oversight committee and <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp along with interested parties in establishing a business plan for the co-operative.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> will also be consulting its lawyers to determine what money is available for funding the co-op.</p>

	<p>The union is looking to determine if they are able to use money from the student space fund, which holds millions of dollars the union has collected for the last decade to someday purchase a student centre. Undergraduates currently pay $1.50 per credit into the fund.</p>

	<p>Despite the conflict, <span class="caps">CSU</span> President Melissa Kate Wheeler says the union is set on fulfilling the mandate given to it by students to open the co-op.<br />
“Disagreements, especially over something this complex and important, are a natural part of decision-making,” she said.</p>

	<p>“We, as representatives of a larger body, are, and should continue to be focused on creating plans which are sustainable, cost-efficient and in keeping with the mandates we receive from our members,” she added. </p>

	<p>“Sometimes this results in conflict, but that isn’t the point. The point is that we’re moving it forward and fulfilling a mandate given to us directly by members of the <span class="caps">CSU</span>.”</p>

			<p>Programming languages make up the Matrix that is behind most new technologies.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>They are ubiquitous and yet we often have no idea they are there. Like any language, they are made up of a series of word combinations (often called tags) that produce the actual words, images and interactive websites on our screens. </p>

	<p>Also like any language, they are constantly being updated in order to be more productive and to support changing technologies.</p>

	<p>Unlike the languages we speak though, there are people and even companies like Google and Microsoft behind every language, supporting the cost of keeping them alive. Those not owned by large companies survive off donations and individuals willing to work for free, similar to Wikipedia. </p>

	<p>Here are some of the most popular coding languages today:</p>

	<p>1. <span class="caps">HTML</span> + <span class="caps">CSS</span> <br />
<span class="caps">HTML</span> (HyperText Markup Language) and <span class="caps">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) are presentation languages, meaning they determine the layout of a webpage. They’re almost always used together and are behind most websites. Plus, they’re the easiest to learn as their structure resembles English. </p>

	<p><span class="caps">HTML</span> was invented by none other than Tim Berners-Lee, co-developer of the World Wide Web, around 1990, when the Internet was making its first steps toward the mainstream. <span class="caps">HTML</span> is used mainly to determine structure and place data (text, tables, etc.). <span class="caps">CSS</span> was designed five or six years later, in 1996, to determine the alignment, text, background colour, font and other characteristics of content on a webpage. </p>

	<p>2. JavaScript<br />
JavaScript is another presentation language that is widely used. It was designed by Brendan Eich in 1995 and is supported by tech companies including Mozilla, creator of the Firefox browser. It’s largely influenced by C and Java languages (described below) and allows for interactive webpages much like the Pulitzer prize-winning Snowfall feature by The New York Times. It’s also used in video games now and even in new smartphones like the upcoming Firefox phone.</p>

	<p>3. <span class="caps">PHP</span><br />
Used for both web-programming and general-purpose programming, <span class="caps">PHP</span> was designed in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and is one of the most popular programming languages because it isn’t too specialized. Most web software, like Wordpress, are written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. And because most web hosts, like GoDaddy, also use <span class="caps">PHP</span>, employers usually look for coders who know it well. </p>

	<p>4. Java<br />
Created by James Gosling in 1995, Java is considered by many as the foundation of corporate computing. It’s a very general and enterprise-oriented language that typically isn’t used for web but is used for anything else, from Blu-Ray players to banking systems. It’s also used to program operating systems by the likes of Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>

	<p>5. C <br />
C is the grandfather of all high-level languages like Java, Javascript, C++ (a very updated version of C) and the near-obsolete Perl. When computers were first invented in the ‘50s and ‘60s, developers had to do everything by hand, including complicated calculations in order for their machines to have a purpose. C was the link between the machine and the programmer. High-level language abstracts lower-level machine code, rendering code more programmer-friendly. It’s powerful because it allows for the creation of fast application on all platforms and is also behind all operating systems and Adobe programs. </p>

	<p>6. Objective-C<br />
Objective-C is one of the early programming languages to resemble C. It was created in 1983 by Brad Cox and Tom Love. It is behind all iPhone applications. </p>

	<p>7. Python<br />
Python is another high-level language like Java and C, but is more readable and learnable. It’s often used in science research programs for it ease of use with mathematics libraries, as it can calculate very large numbers quickly. It was originally published in 1991 and is now invested in heavily by Google, so it’s bound to stick around for a while. Image-sharing applications and websites like Instagram and Pinterest use Python. </p>

	<p>8. Ruby<br />
Essentially the equivalent of Python—the two could be compared to Windows and Mac—Ruby was published in 1995 and was designed by Japanese developer Yukihiro Matsumoto. Its popularity stems from a framework called “Ruby on Rails” which facilitates the creation of websites coded in Ruby. These include include Shopify, Groupon and Twitter, which eventually switched to Java. </p>

	<p>9. C#<br />
Another offshoot of grandpa C, C# (pronounced “C-sharp”) is a general-purpose programming language used to write Microsoft programs like Xbox and Windows. It was created in 2000 by Microsoft.</p>

			<p>The last university in Montreal to officially oppose Bill 60, Concordia will be the first to present its position at hearings in Quebec City on Thursday.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Concordia delegates will face the National Assembly at 2 p.m. to elaborate on a Dec. 17 statement that disagreed with key elements of the bill, also known as the Charter of Quebec Values. </p>

	<p>“Many thought we were very late to the party,” said Concordia President Alan Shepard at a university Senate meeting on Friday. “Turns out by the fact that we’re testifying next week—and this [consultation] goes on until March—that we were probably one of the first to submit.</p>

	<p>“Just like term papers or final exams, they all came in at the last minute.”</p>

	<p>The hearings on the bill began on Jan. 14 and are scheduled until Feb. 7. </p>

	<p>Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and VP Academic Affairs, and Roger Côté, VP Services, were chosen to present the university’s case. </p>

	<p>“This will be a stressful moment for them because the various political parties will be in the room. Everyone will try to score points off one another with us as the vehicle or medium by which that might take place,” Shepard said. “We don’t want to be taken advantage of by any political party in terms of how we present our ideas.”</p>

	<p>Although it supports elements of the bill, the Concordia administration criticized the proposed ban on visible religious symbols.</p>

	<p>“You can agree with the principles of a lay state, equality between men and women, but the ostentatious religious symbols ban is a real problem for us,” said Chris Mota, university spokesperson.</p>

	<p>The ban would affect more than 7,000 full- and part-time employees of the university, hindering research and student recruitment, according to an official statement by Concordia.</p>

	<p>“We need to have a community that’s really diverse—and we do and it’s a huge strength for us—and I would do everything that I can to protect that diversity and to celebrate it,” said Shepard in an <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4467">interview</a> with <em>The Link</em> last fall.</p>

	<p>Concordia also takes issue with the charter on other grounds, Mota said. </p>

	<p>“Universities are built on democratic thinking, freedom of thought and expression,” she said. “Having that kind of law governing universities would be infringing on their autonomy.”</p>

	<p>The university officially registered its disapproval after receiving over 200 emails from students, faculty, and staff. </p>

	<p>“This is a bill that people were passionate about on both sides. We wanted to hear from our community, and that takes time,” Mota added. </p>

	<p>The university’s position was endorsed by 11 associations and student groups, including Concordia’s full- and part-time faculty unions, the Graduate Students’ Association, and the Concordia Student Union—which first voiced its opposition to the charter in a unanimous council vote in September.</p>

	<p>Concordia’s hour-long presentation at the National Assembly on Thursday will be followed by a brief question-and-answer period. The entire debate will be webcast on the <a href="http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/video-audio/index.html">National Assembly website</a> and Radio-Canada.ca. </p>

			<p><i>What Can Esperanto Do For You?</i></p>

			<p>The world is home to about 6,500 spoken languages.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>But what if there was one spoken by everyone? </p>

	<p>This was the dream of 19th century Polish linguist Ludwik Lazarus Zamenhof. A native of Bialystok, Poland, Zamenhof’s hometown was equally home to Polish, Belarusian, Russian and German communities, prompting a language gap between residents. </p>

	<p>It is this language gap that spurred Zamenhof’s belief that a universal language could be the key to achieving world piece. In 1887 he took it upon himself to create one: Esperanto— which translates to “the one who hopes.”</p>

	<p>“Esperanto is what we call a constructed language, that many people learn as a hobby,” said Morgan Sonderegger, an assistant professor of linguistics at McGill University. “A constructed language is one that someone or a group of people made up all the rules and vocabulary for; [one] that didn’t arise as a natural language [such as] English or Mandarin.”</p>

	<p>The majority of Esperanto’s roots are Latin, though some vocabulary is taken from modern languages such as English, German, Polish, Russian and French. </p>

	<p>Since Esperanto’s first world congress organized in France in 1905, it has been recognized as an alternate international language by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p>

	<p>Today, statistics show that there are between 100,000 and 2 million active or fluent Esperanto speakers worldwide. The International Academy of Sciences in San Marino, Italy, has even made Esperanto its current language of instruction.</p>

	<p>“It all depends on the person’s capacities, but Esperanto is fairly easy to learn, even more for someone who speaks French or Spanish,” says Zdravka Metz, who co-founded the Société québécoise d’espéranto in 1982.</p>

	<p>“You can learn it in less than a month if you put effort into it.”</p>

	<p>If you already speak English, the most widely used language in the world, there may seem to be little point in learning Esperanto. Metz says that isn’t the case.</p>

	<p>“Here in North America, English and French are enough for you to make yourself understood, but if you travel in Europe, English isn’t enough,” says Metz, who grew up in Croatia, about 30 kilometres away from the Hungarian border.</p>

	<p>“If you’re a scientist, a mathematician or a computer engineer and you want to share information with your peers worldwide, you won’t translate your work in each main language; it’s way more useful to communicate in Esperanto,” she added.</p>

	<p>But could Esperanto actually replace English as the world’s universal language?</p>

	<p>“Maybe, I don’t know,” Metz admitted. “Because when you learn Esperanto, you won’t necessarily find a career [in the language].”</p>

	<p>For Metz, the role of Esperanto today isn’t so much achieving world peace, as its creator originally hoped it would, as much as simply facilitating international communication.  </p>

	<p>“I don’t think it’s essential for everyone to learn Esperanto, but it all depends on what you want to do in your life and how you want to use it to your own advantage,” said Metz. “If you like travelling once in a while, it can be useful to learn some of it, but if you want to work in the business world, for example, it might be useful for you to master it so can deal with people all over the world.”</p>

			<p>The world is home to about 6,500 spoken languages.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>But what if there was one spoken by everyone? </p>

	<p>This was the dream of 19th century Polish linguist Ludwik Lazarus Zamenhof. A native of Bialystok, Poland, Zamenhof’s hometown was equally home to Polish, Belarusian, Russian and German communities, prompting a language gap between residents. </p>

	<p>It is this language gap that spurred Zamenhof’s belief that a universal language could be the key to achieving world piece. In 1887 he took it upon himself to create one: Esperanto— which translates to “the one who hopes.”</p>

	<p>“Esperanto is what we call a constructed language, that many people learn as a hobby,” said Morgan Sonderegger, an assistant professor of linguistics at McGill University. “A constructed language is one that someone or a group of people made up all the rules and vocabulary for; [one] that didn’t arise as a natural language [such as] English or Mandarin.”</p>

	<p>The majority of Esperanto’s roots are Latin, though some vocabulary is taken from modern languages such as English, German, Polish, Russian and French. </p>

	<p>Since Esperanto’s first world congress organized in France in 1905, it has been recognized as an alternate international language by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p>

	<p>Today, statistics show that there are between 100,000 and 2 million active or fluent Esperanto speakers worldwide. The International Academy of Sciences in San Marino, Italy, has even made Esperanto its current language of instruction.</p>

	<p>“It all depends on the person’s capacities, but Esperanto is fairly easy to learn, even more for someone who speaks French or Spanish,” says Zdravka Metz, who co-founded the Société québécoise d’espéranto in 1982.</p>

	<p>“You can learn it in less than a month if you put effort into it.”</p>

	<p>If you already speak English, the most widely used language in the world, there may seem to be little point in learning Esperanto. Metz says that isn’t the case.</p>

	<p>“Here in North America, English and French are enough for you to make yourself understood, but if you travel in Europe, English isn’t enough,” says Metz, who grew up in Croatia, about 30 kilometres away from the Hungarian border.</p>

	<p>“If you’re a scientist, a mathematician or a computer engineer and you want to share information with your peers worldwide, you won’t translate your work in each main language; it’s way more useful to communicate in Esperanto,” she added.</p>

	<p>But could Esperanto actually replace English as the world’s universal language?</p>

					<p>With the job market’s consistently increasing competitiveness and fast pace, it feels like the further from the status quo our resumes are, the better our opportunities. </p>

	<p>Apart from significant Twitter mentions and your Klout score, something that’s often taken for granted—but is only growing in importance in employers’ eyes—is language.</p>

	<p>How many languages you speak, how fluently and even how you learned them may all be sweet spots for the professional you’re trying to woo across the table, says Mark Goldenberg, a former federal assistant deputy minister who now conducts research for the University of Ottawa. </p>

	<p>“[Language] especially stands out by what it says about the individual’s openness—openness to other cultures, to learning new things,” said Goldenberg, who led a study entitled “Two Languages: A World of Opportunities” in 2009. The study focused on bilingual education at the university level by the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages. </p>

	<p>“Workplaces aren’t the same, and it’s the end of your academic career, so if you don’t use it, you lose it,” added Goldenberg on the importance of acquiring or perfecting a second language at the university level.</p>

	<p>The study attempted to assess the level of second-language learning in universities across the country. Given that French is Quebec’s official language, but that it’s a minority in the country, both English and French universities in the province recognized the need for a strong understanding of the two languages, and therefore a need for such a study, Goldenberg said.</p>

	<p>But what Goldenberg’s team found were “serious gaps and unmet needs” in intensive second-language learning in universities across the country, which is the most effective way to see results when learning a second language, according to the study.</p>

	<p>Despite its uniqueness in Canada and its universities’ “increasing awareness of globalism,” Goldenberg found that second-language teaching was conducted much the same way as it was in the rest of Canada.</p>

	<p>The study published a series of findings and recommendations for universities in Canada to improve second-language learning. Among them were the fact that content-based learning in a second language—like taking a non-language based course in your second language—increases your chances of mastering it. </p>

	<p>It also recommended that Francophone universities establish exchange programs with Anglophone ones and vice versa.</p>

	<p>Two Montreal <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s are experimenting with just that—a program that, in many ways, resembles what the <span class="caps">OCOL</span> suggested universities do five years ago.</p>

	<p>Next-door neighbours Vanier College and <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> de Saint-Laurent are hosting students from across the lawn for over a third of their course load as part of an exchange program between the two colleges, aiming at improving students’ second-language skills.</p>

	<p>Although private Montreal <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s Marianopolis College and Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf started a similar exchange program a few years ago, Vanier and <span class="caps">CSL</span> are the first public <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s to go ahead with it, “signed by Quebec’s education minister [Marie Malavoy] and all,” said Loris Peternelli, the program’s coordinator and a professor at Vanier, referring to the process of approval by Quebec’s ministry of education. </p>

	<p>Though the collaboration between the two schools and its focus on content-based learning follow the very principles the <span class="caps">OCOL</span> highlighted in its study, the program is not based on the study, nor did it consult the Commissioner’s office, according to Peternelli.</p>

	<p>Apart from the two CEGEP’s proximity, the “great choice of universities and the doors it opens” were the main reasons for the initiative. </p>

	<p>In September 2013, 10 <span class="caps">CSL</span> and four Vanier students became the first to test out the new program. Each of them is taking four courses at the other school, including chemistry for those in science and western civilization for those in social science.</p>

	<p>The program had been in the works for a few years, but due to an extensive back-and-forth with the ministry of education, was only finalized just in time for the beginning of the school year, hence the small number of students enrolled.</p>

	<p>“It’s not for everyone, but a 30- to 40-student cohort is a good objective,” said Peternelli, adding that now one semester in, the students’ experience seems positive so far and that they had integrated very well with the other institution.</p>

	<p>The goal is for students to feel comfortable and be fluent in the other language by the time they get their diploma of college studies, said Peternelli. To complete their <span class="caps">DEC</span> with the exchange under their belt, students not only write the usual <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> exit exam in their main college’s language, but in the other as well.</p>

	<p>“We have quite a variety of levels—most of the students have a strong mastery of French while the English varies, but, like they say, if you want to get something done, ask a busy person,” added Peternelli, explaining that students needed an above-80 average to participate in the program.</p>

	<p>Peternelli says he gets to meet with the students every once in a while to see how they’re progressing within the program’s framework and how they’re integrating at the opposite school. Last time he met with them was before their one-month winter break between semesters.</p>

	<p>“So far, it’s really positive and they’re integrating really well,” he said. “I don’t know how walking across the way is going to go in the winter, but that may be the only drag.”</p>

			<p><i>&#8216;Welcome Classes&#8217; Introduce Immigrant Children to French Language, Quebec Culture</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/Special/18spe.WelcomeClasses.graeme.WEB_690_363_90.jpg" alt="" />

			<p>Picture a class of children each from a different corner of the globe. Some have been in the country for a few weeks, others several months. There may be two or three from one country or another but only one speaks Spanish, one Arabic, one Ewondo…</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Nevertheless, when they’re in class with their teacher, they’re not allowed to speak Spanish or Arabic or Ewondo. They are all expected to speak only French.</p>

	<p>This is Quebec, after all, and their class is a classe de francisation or classe d’accueil—translated as welcome class.<br />
At École des Cinq-Continents, an elementary school in Montreal’s Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood, Manon Dubreuil has taught welcome classes at various grade levels for 20 years.</p>

	<p>The goal, says Dubreuil, is to “make [students] functional orally so that they can integrate as soon as possible into a regular class.”</p>

 “Welcome classes are not just about learning a second language but about integrating into Quebec society,” she said. “For example, someone who is born in a country with completely different values, they aren’t necessarily used to speaking, to having the right to express themselves.”

	<p>Students can be admitted to the welcome class at any point in the school year, Dubreuil said. </p>

	<p>“Normally, they stay in the class for 10 months, and those who need it can stay another 10 months,” she added. </p>

	<p>Dubreuil, who also teaches and supervises student teachers at the Université du Québec à Montréal, said her biggest challenge is preventing students from speaking their mother tongues in class.</p>

	<p>Quebec’s Charter of the French Language—also known as Bill 101—was passed in 1977 and states that the province’s official language is French. The law requires that children be educated in French until the end of secondary school, whether in a public school or a government-subsidized private school.</p>

	<p>However, there are exceptions. One involves the granting of a Certificate of Eligibility, primarily to students with a Canadian citizen as a parent or a family member educated in English in Canada. Additionally, there are special and temporary authorizations available for students in extenuating circumstances.</p>

	<p>Also exempt from Bill 101 are those enrolled in non-subsidized—and generally more expensive—private schools, those who are homeschooled, as well as &#8220;Amerind&#8221; or Inuit students.</p>

	<p>But the majority of children and teens who arrive in Quebec as immigrants end up in French public schools. Most of them can already speak French and go straight into regular classes, although some benefit from a little extra help. Those who cannot are placed in classes like Dubreuil’s.</p>

	<p>In 2012, only about 38 per cent of immigrants arriving in Quebec did not already speak French, down from 49 percent in 2003, according to a recent article in <em>La Presse</em>. This number is expected to continue to fall as the provincial government implements measures favoring immigrants from French-speaking countries like France, Haiti, Algeria and Morocco.</p>

	<p>As a result, the number of students in welcome classes is also falling. In Montreal elementary schools, 3,856 students were enrolled in welcome classes in 2009-2010, compared to 3,258 in 2011-2012. This last figure represents about three per cent of all Montreal elementary school students. </p>

	<p>Some have argued that welcome classes do more harm than good, marginalizing new arrivals by labelling them language deficient and isolating them from their mainstream peers. </p>

	<p>“Well, that’s ridiculous,” said Dubreuil. “That’s completely crazy. They’re not deficient of anything, they’re learning a second language.</p>

	<p>“Try to imagine spending an entire day in a class in Chinese, with students speaking Chinese. Imagine how exhausted you would be at the end of the day,” she continued.</p>

	<p>Dubreuil added that welcome class teachers work with regular class teachers to try and help the new students integrate. </p>

	<p>“If a student in math, for example, is ready to integrate into a regular class, the regular teacher can accept to take them once or twice a week,” she said. </p>

	<p>“[Students] usually have fond memories of their welcome class.”</p>

	<p>Dan Grigore does. He arrived from Romania with his family at the age of 11. After joining the Grade 5 welcome class at his LaSalle elementary school, he started Grade 6 in the mainstream class in September.</p>

	<p>“It was a wonderful experience,” said Grigore, who had already learned a few words in French in Romania. “I think the teachers were very patient with us.”</p>

	<p>But what Grigore remembers best, aside from a class field trip to the cabane à sucre, is the friends he made in the welcome class and the support they provided.</p>

	<p>“Being with kids who are in a similar situation as you, going through the same experiences and learning together at the same level, it helps a lot while you’re being introduced to your new culture, to your new country,” he said. </p>

	<p>Grigore went on to learn English as a third language and completed a BA in commerce at Concordia in 2009. Looking back, he wonders how things would have been different  had he not had the welcome class.</p>

	<p>“I think if I had been thrown into the regular system without the [welcome class] or without other kids who had similar experiences, maybe I would have been more introverted, or had a lot of trouble making friends,” said Grigore.</p>

	<p>In terms of academics, he added, “I don’t know how I would have performed against the Québécois kids.”</p>

	<p>Not that the welcome classes are without problems. For example, like many teachers in mainstream classes, Dubreuil said that she is seeing more and more students with behavioural and psychological difficulties.</p>

	<p>But there are other issues unique to the welcome class.</p>

	<p>“For some time, there have been underprivileged students who don’t necessarily have services. The welcome class is considered the service,” said Dubreuil. “Some are under-educated in their mother tongues.”</p>

	<p>She suggested that the diversity of the students’ home environments also presents challenges in the classroom.</p>

	<p>“These are kids who live a completely different reality at home compared to their peers, because at home they keep their traditions, like their way of eating.</p>

	<p>“The other problem is parents who don’t speak French, so they don’t necessarily have help with their homework,” Dubreuil added.</p>

	<p>“But these are students who succeed pretty well anyway, in spite of the uphill battle they face.”</p>

	<p>On the plus side, her welcome classes are significantly smaller than the norm, with a maximum of 18 students. Also, she said that the students are generally more respectful, often coming from cultures that place more value in formal education.</p>

	<p>“The students get very attached to us,” said Dubreuil. “The welcome teachers have maybe a warmer approach. We have a special link with the children because they get attached to us and we’re their first link to the new society.</p>

			<p><i>&#8216;Welcome Classes&#8217; Introduce Immigrant Children to French Language, Quebec Culture</i></p>

			<p>Picture a class of children each from a different corner of the globe. Some have been in the country for a few weeks, others several months. There may be two or three from one country or another but only one speaks Spanish, one Arabic, one Ewondo…</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Nevertheless, when they’re in class with their teacher, they’re not allowed to speak Spanish or Arabic or Ewondo. They are all expected to speak only French.</p>

	<p>This is Quebec, after all, and their class is a classe de francisation or classe d’accueil—translated as welcome class.<br />
At École des Cinq-Continents, an elementary school in Montreal’s Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood, Manon Dubreuil has taught welcome classes at various grade levels for 20 years.</p>

	<p>The goal, says Dubreuil, is to “make [students] functional orally so that they can integrate as soon as possible into a regular class.”</p>

 “Welcome classes are not just about learning a second language but about integrating into Quebec society,” she said. “For example, someone who is born in a country with completely different values, they aren’t necessarily used to speaking, to having the right to express themselves.”

	<p>Students can be admitted to the welcome class at any point in the school year, Dubreuil said. </p>

	<p>“Normally, they stay in the class for 10 months, and those who need it can stay another 10 months,” she added. </p>

	<p>Dubreuil, who also teaches and supervises student teachers at the Université du Québec à Montréal, said her biggest challenge is preventing students from speaking their mother tongues in class.</p>

	<p>Quebec’s Charter of the French Language—also known as Bill 101—was passed in 1977 and states that the province’s official language is French. The law requires that children be educated in French until the end of secondary school, whether in a public school or a government-subsidized private school.</p>

	<p>However, there are exceptions. One involves the granting of a Certificate of Eligibility, primarily to students with a Canadian citizen as a parent or a family member educated in English in Canada. Additionally, there are special and temporary authorizations available for students in extenuating circumstances.</p>

	<p>Also exempt from Bill 101 are those enrolled in non-subsidized—and generally more expensive—private schools, those who are homeschooled, as well as &#8220;Amerind&#8221; or Inuit students.</p>

	<p>But the majority of children and teens who arrive in Quebec as immigrants end up in French public schools. Most of them can already speak French and go straight into regular classes, although some benefit from a little extra help. Those who cannot are placed in classes like Dubreuil’s.</p>

	<p>In 2012, only about 38 per cent of immigrants arriving in Quebec did not already speak French, down from 49 percent in 2003, according to a recent article in <em>La Presse</em>. This number is expected to continue to fall as the provincial government implements measures favoring immigrants from French-speaking countries like France, Haiti, Algeria and Morocco.</p>

	<p>As a result, the number of students in welcome classes is also falling. In Montreal elementary schools, 3,856 students were enrolled in welcome classes in 2009-2010, compared to 3,258 in 2011-2012. This last figure represents about three per cent of all Montreal elementary school students. </p>

	<p>Some have argued that welcome classes do more harm than good, marginalizing new arrivals by labelling them language deficient and isolating them from their mainstream peers. </p>

	<p>“Well, that’s ridiculous,” said Dubreuil. “That’s completely crazy. They’re not deficient of anything, they’re learning a second language.</p>

	<p>“Try to imagine spending an entire day in a class in Chinese, with students speaking Chinese. Imagine how exhausted you would be at the end of the day,” she continued.</p>

	<p>Dubreuil added that welcome class teachers work with regular class teachers to try and help the new students integrate. </p>

	<p>“If a student in math, for example, is ready to integrate into a regular class, the regular teacher can accept to take them once or twice a week,” she said. </p>

	<p>“[Students] usually have fond memories of their welcome class.”</p>

	<p>Dan Grigore does. He arrived from Romania with his family at the age of 11. After joining the Grade 5 welcome class at his LaSalle elementary school, he started Grade 6 in the mainstream class in September.</p>

	<p>“It was a wonderful experience,” said Grigore, who had already learned a few words in French in Romania. “I think the teachers were very patient with us.”</p>

	<p>But what Grigore remembers best, aside from a class field trip to the cabane à sucre, is the friends he made in the welcome class and the support they provided.</p>

	<p>“Being with kids who are in a similar situation as you, going through the same experiences and learning together at the same level, it helps a lot while you’re being introduced to your new culture, to your new country,” he said. </p>

	<p>Grigore went on to learn English as a third language and completed a BA in commerce at Concordia in 2009. Looking back, he wonders how things would have been different  had he not had the welcome class.</p>

	<p>“I think if I had been thrown into the regular system without the [welcome class] or without other kids who had similar experiences, maybe I would have been more introverted, or had a lot of trouble making friends,” said Grigore.</p>

	<p>In terms of academics, he added, “I don’t know how I would have performed against the Québécois kids.”</p>

	<p>Not that the welcome classes are without problems. For example, like many teachers in mainstream classes, Dubreuil said that she is seeing more and more students with behavioural and psychological difficulties.</p>

	<p>But there are other issues unique to the welcome class.</p>

	<p>“For some time, there have been underprivileged students who don’t necessarily have services. The welcome class is considered the service,” said Dubreuil. “Some are under-educated in their mother tongues.”</p>

	<p>She suggested that the diversity of the students’ home environments also presents challenges in the classroom.</p>

	<p>“These are kids who live a completely different reality at home compared to their peers, because at home they keep their traditions, like their way of eating.</p>

	<p>“The other problem is parents who don’t speak French, so they don’t necessarily have help with their homework,” Dubreuil added.</p>

	<p>“But these are students who succeed pretty well anyway, in spite of the uphill battle they face.”</p>

	<p>On the plus side, her welcome classes are significantly smaller than the norm, with a maximum of 18 students. Also, she said that the students are generally more respectful, often coming from cultures that place more value in formal education.</p>

	<p>“The students get very attached to us,” said Dubreuil. “The welcome teachers have maybe a warmer approach. We have a special link with the children because they get attached to us and we’re their first link to the new society.</p>

	<p>“I know at a certain point [the provincial government was] talking about eliminating the welcome classes,” she continued. “I think that’s really not a good idea. The students should maybe get more services, but the system works relatively well.” </p>

			<p><i>Quebec Must Let Go Of Its &#8216;Us vs. Them&#8217; Mentality</i></p>

			<p>As I sat in my Intro to Psychology class last semester, I heard the professor say the words that best described my frustration with living in Quebec.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The words were “us vs. them.” It’s a mentality described in Henri Tajfel and John Turner’s highly influential Social Identity Theory.</p>

	<p>This theory proposes that people belong to certain social groups and have a sense of who they are based on their group memberships. These groups have sets of social rules that members will follow to be considered “us,” or to fit in. </p>

	<p>I was born and raised in Montreal. My parents immigrated to Canada from Italy in the ‘50s. Starting over in a new country had its challenges. From the many stories I’ve heard, Italian immigrants were considered “them” for a long time. They were treated like the unwanted.</p>

 I can see why they created their own tight-knit community, protecting what was known and loved back home while fiercely securing its imaginary boundaries with social rules. 

	<p>They formed their own version of “us” and anyone on the outside of it was excluded, while those on the inside were conditioned to stay well within its limits. It was only once I ventured beyond the community’s circle of influence that I saw a much more open and diverse world. </p>

	<p>It made me curious, but it was a while before I was courageous enough to break out of my community’s hold. I never did well in a box that limited me to someone else’s idea of what’s best, right or good. I needed to figure that out for myself.</p>

	<p>Living in Quebec at large feels a lot like my childhood experience. Although I understand that Quebec has a rich history and every reason to want to hold on to their language and heritage, the approach used for doing so divides us as a population and limits us.</p>

	<p>Quebec pours energy, tax dollars and resources into ensuring we are served in French, educated in French, and advertised to in French. </p>

	<p>Meanwhile, there are pools of unused potential in Quebecers that are stuck in frustrated stagnation because of the state of affairs. </p>

	<p>I’ve seen it in the cab driver who told me his story of being a medical doctor in his homeland but having to drive a cab here instead. </p>

	<p>I’ve seen it in the nurse who has an incredible manner to help humans but his Martinique passport does not open any doors, forcing him to return to his native soil. </p>

	<p>I’ve seen it in the autistic young adult who is a genius with animation and video games but will no longer have services to help him put this talent to good use once he’s 21 with a mental age of 14. </p>

	<p>He’ll most likely end up on welfare, playing video games in his basement. These people are all French-speaking and able and willing to work hard. Is protecting the language truly ensuring a healthy and thriving Quebec? </p>

	<p>Language is no longer what humans need to be protecting. What needs protecting, more than anything, is the quality of human life and the mining and realizing of human potential. </p>

	<p>The old-school Italian community created an environment that lacked openness and failed to evolve in a new world, and Quebec has done the same thing. </p>

	<p>In its need to conserve a language and status, Quebec has failed to acknowledge that the world is opening up and is offering ample possibilities for those willing to embrace change. It’s hanging on tightly to what used to be at the cost of great opportunities in what could be. </p>

	<p>I guess you can say I’m a dreamer. I believe in bringing down the barriers that divide. My social identity is that I’m human. Everything else is up for grabs. I am a proud Quebecer and a proud member of the Italo-Canadian community. </p>

	<p>I see much beauty and richness in both, but it’s their limiting and dividing rules that I no longer choose to abide by. I am fluently trilingual, but more importantly, I understand and speak the languages of collaboration, acceptance, unity and human interaction. What else do I need? </p>

	<p>It’s time to let go of this province’s “us vs. them” mentality and create a new reality to show the world what we’re really about.</p>

			<p>For many Concordia students, this year marks their first time living in a big city.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Having to adapt to the various cultures found in and around Montreal can also be challenging. But what if Concordia was also the first time you were learning in a new language altogether?</p>

	<p>For three members of Concordia’s women’s hockey team, defenders Marie-Joëlle Allard and Caroll-Ann Gagné, and forward Anne-Julie Deschênes, coming to Concordia was a huge transition­—not only in the classroom, but also on the ice.</p>

	<p>“For me, the transition from French to English was especially hard because I never studied or spoke much English,” said Gagné, who was born and raised in Fermont, Quebec near the Labrador border. “I do think that the transition has been a process. I succeeded my first semester in English, and I know that I still have lots to learn but I also know that I still have months and years to learn.”</p>

	<p>Gagné’s usual defensive counterpart, Allard, was in a different boat regarding her transition. </p>

	<p>“It’s coming along really well,” said the Victoriaville native. “I actually find that English is a lot easier to learn than French.”</p>

	<p>Deschenes, who played with Allard at <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> Limoilou, seems to side more with her former teammate than Gagné.</p>

	<p>“It’s going really well for me, I keep getting better,” said the Mont-Joli native. “I’m quite satisfied with my grades of last semester, and my teachers have been understanding.”</p>

	<p>At the rink, the fact that practices are held in English by coaches Les Lawton and Mike McGrath can make things difficult at times. </p>

	<p>Fortunately for the francophones on the team—who account for eight of the 22-player squad—two of their other coaches are French-speaking, Lise Marie-Breton and Dave Paré. </p>

	<p>Among their own ranks, the rookie trio say they’re fortunate to always have someone to turn to when they’re stuck thinking of a word or an expression.  </p>

 “From the very beginning the girls have been very supportive and helpful,” said Gagné. “They’ll help explain what the coaches are saying, and even sometimes the coaches will try to speak to us in French too.”

	<p>“They know what we’re going through and really go out of their way to help us,” added Allard. “They want to be there for support, not to laugh at us. And playing with my best friend [Marie-Pier] Cloutier is really a dream. She helps me on and off the ice.”</p>

	<p>It also helps to have family, friends and love ones to turn to during the transition for a helping hand. </p>

 “My father went through the same struggles and process when he went to study in the United States so he helps me out a lot,” said Deschênes. “My boyfriend also studied <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> in English so he knows my situation well.”

	<p>It nonetheless begs the question: why attend Concordia University, not only an Anglophone university but one far from the likes of Victoriaville and Fermont, in the first place? </p>

	<p>The players’ answers all had their personal touches, with one major thing in common.</p>

	<p>“It was definitely because they had the program I wanted to become an athletic therapist,” said Allard, who’s studying exercise science. </p>

	<p>“It’s the only university that offers the program so it wasn’t a difficult choice. It also didn’t hurt that when I was playing in <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>, Les approached me with the concept of a rebuild in women’s hockey,” she continued. </p>

	<p>“And maybe it’ll sound cliché, but learning English was also an interest of mine.”</p>

	<p>Concordia also offered the program Deschênes wanted to join.</p>

	<p>“I decided to come to Concordia because I really wanted to continue playing hockey while getting my degree. Being in administration, I know that it’ll be very useful, especially considering the John Molson School of Business is a great school,” said Deschênes, who then echoed Allard’s comment. “I also decided to come here because I wanted to learn English.”</p>

	<p>Gagné’s explanation was similar. </p>

	<p>“I chose to come here definitely for their strong hockey program,” said the psychology major. “But I also did want to learn how to speak and write English because I know how important that’ll be later on in life.”</p>

	<p>It nonetheless begs the question: why attend Concordia University, not only an Anglophone university but one far from the likes of Victoriaville and Fermont, in the first place? </p>

	<p>The players’ answers all had their personal touches, with one major thing in common.</p>

	<p>“It was definitely because they had the program I wanted to become an athletic therapist,” said Allard, who’s studying exercise science. </p>

	<p>“It’s the only university that offers the program so it wasn’t a difficult choice. It also didn’t hurt that when I was playing in <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>, Les approached me with the concept of a rebuild in women’s hockey,” she continued. </p>

	<p>“And maybe it’ll sound cliché, but learning English was also an interest of mine.”</p>

	<p>Concordia also offered the program Deschênes wanted to join.</p>

	<p>“I decided to come to Concordia because I really wanted to continue playing hockey while getting my degree. Being in administration, I know that it’ll be very useful, especially considering the John Molson School of Business is a great school,” said Deschênes, who then echoed Allard’s comment. “I also decided to come here because I wanted to learn English.”</p>

	<p>Gagné’s explanation was similar. </p>

	<p>“I chose to come here definitely for their strong hockey program,” said the psychology major. “But I also did want to learn how to speak and write English because I know how important that’ll be later on in life.”</p>

			<p>Quebec’s culture must be preserved—but I don’t mean the one Pauline Marois has in mind when she says the same.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Since the days of the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, the Quebec government has worked tirelessly to ensure the vitality of the French language and Québécois—or pure laine—  culture in the province. And that’s certainly admirable.</p>

	<p>But the way the province has undertaken that task has been to repress its own minority linguistic and cultural communities.</p>

	<p>And that’s absolutely wrong. </p>

	<p>Bill 101 tells you what school you can attend. </p>

	<p>The Office Québécois de la langue française tells you “pasta” cannot be written on a menu and in what language you can and can’t address your colleagues at work.</p>

	<p>Today, with the Charter of Values, the government wants to tell you how to dress.</p>

	<p>This spring, if an election is indeed called and the Parti Québécois becomes a majority government, the party stated it will seek to re-introduce Bill 14, which would prohibit the province’s own native francophones from receiving an education in English not only through high school—as is the current case—but through <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> as well.</p>

	<p>And it’s all in an attempt to protect the French language and preserve the Québécois culture. </p>

	<p>And yet, French and the Québécoiscommunity aren’t on the verge of disappearing anytime soon in Quebec.  </p>

	<p>Nearly 95 per cent of Quebecers said they knew French in the 2011 Canadian census, and it’s the language most often spoken at home for 81 per cent of the province.</p>

	<p>Talk show Tout le monde en parle is the province’s most-watched TV program and over 83 per cent of the population is Catholic—a defining aspect of the province’s heritage, as Premier Marois has made clear with her campaign to keep the crucifix in the National Assembly despite her push for secularism in the province. </p>

	<p>Indeed, pure laine culture is firmly entrenched throughout the province. It’s not because of Bill 101—it’s simply due to the fact that, in the overwhelming majority of the province, most cities identify with one language and one culture. </p>

	<p>As demographer Marc Termote told Maclean’s in 2011, “You will [speak only] French in Chicoutimi.”   </p>

	<p>It’s a different story down in Montreal. </p>

	<p>Here, French isn’t the majority’s mother tongue. </p>

	<p>Neither is English, for that matter. Instead, over one-third of the city’s residents are visible minorities and over half are non-francophones. </p>

	<p>The allophones dominate in Montreal. </p>

	<p>Ironically, this is mostly the provincial government’s own doing. </p>

	<p>Rather than work to increase the birth rate once it fell below the replacement rate in the ‘70s, Quebec instead decided to make up for the disparity by admitting more immigrants to the province, over 90 per cent of whom naturally settle in its biggest city. </p>

	<p>Couple this surge of new immigrants with a consistently growing number of francophone Montrealers moving to greener pastures in the suburbs in recent years, and the result is a declining pure laine community in the city—to the point that it may eventually disappear entirely. </p>

	<p>Quebec’s answer to all of this hasn’t been to try and reverse the trend. </p>

	<p>Instead, it has focused primarily on establishing the supremacy of the French language and the pure laine culture under the umbrella of interculturalism. </p>

	<p>Rather than seeing all cultures as equals under multiculturalism—a policy the rest of Canada has adopted—Quebec has instead imposed upon immigrants to the province and its centuries-old anglophone communities “a public culture […] patterned after [francophones’] own needs, their own priorities and, most of all, their own particular sense of identity,” as Concordia political science professor Daniel Salée wrote in his academic article “Quebec Sovereignty and the Challenge of Linguistic and Ethnocultural Minorities: Identity, Difference and the Politics of Ressentiment.” </p>

	<p>No wonder so many immigrants to Quebec and the province’s native Anglophones are high-tailing it westward by the busload. </p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the Quebec government has yet to realize that a culture isn’t preserved by imposing on people to adopt it, and that a province doesn’t become unified by dictating what language its residents can speak or by having them choose between their religious beliefs or their job. </p>

	<p>The Quebec government has yet to realize that “Quebec’s culture” doesn’t mean solely pure laine culture. </p>

	<p>Quebec’s culture has become a genuine mosaic, and repressing some components of that mosaic in favor of others is not the answer to keeping French from declining in Montreal.</p>

	<p>What the government’s policies have accomplished instead is to increase ethnic tensions, shrink Montreal’s linguistic communities and limit the province’s own francophones’ opportunities to expand their eligibility in an English-dominated global job market. </p>

	<p>The surge in Islamophobia since the Charter of Values was announced, the all-time low enrolments in English schools this year and the fact that more and more allophones and francophones are attending anglophone <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s in hopes of improving their English reveals as much.  </p>

	<p>It is time our government comes to terms with the fact that Quebec is multicultural, and that this is something to be celebrated; that it is an asset, not a threat.   </p>

	<p>It is time our premier realized that allophones, like Anglophones, have just as much right to their language and culture being preserved as that of her own.</p>

			<p>Quebecers agree on a lot of things—language isn’t one of them.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>In the past year alone, Quebec has made headlines not only across the nation but also internationally with such controversial affairs as Pastagate and Bill 60. </p>

	<p>But for Beryl Wajsman, these are more than just headlines in the newspaper. He says anglophones and allophones in Quebec are being discriminated against based on language.</p>

	<p>“If you’re a small business employing 15 people, and you put your money to work, many, many small businesses are owned by immigrants and if they can’t be communicated with in [English], based on their needs, they’re just going to close the door,” said Wajsman, editor at <em>The Suburban</em> and publisher of <em>The Métropolitain</em>, in reference to the government’s recent decision to go ahead with a policy introduced in 2011 to only interact with businesses in French.</p>

	<p>Wajsman is not alone. He’s part of what Richard Yufe, spokesperson for a group dubbed Canadian Rights in Quebec, called “a movement for language equality in Quebec” on Daybreak Montreal in May 2012.</p>

	<p>The movement Yufe referred to is the resurgence of interest groups defending the place of the English language in the province.</p>

	<p>Along with the election of the Parti Québécois in September 2012, newsmakers like the Pastagate affair, Bill 60 and, more recently, Creolegate, have caused much ink to be spilled on the hot topic that is Quebec’s language dynamics. <br />
Think pieces of all sorts brought up the idea of the proverbial space taken up by the two languages spoken in the province.</p>

	<p>Though officially francophone, Quebec’s—and in particular Montreal’s—bilingualism is often seen as one of its strongest assets. Over 42 per cent of the province’s population speaks both English and French, according to the 2011 Canadian census.</p>

	<p>The idea of a language divide in Quebec is nothing new, but it doesn’t have the same momentum as in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, when approximately 130,000 of the province’s English-speakers left for fear of not being served in their language after Bill 101 passed in 1977.</p>

	<p>According to a recently released report from the Canadian Institute for Identities and Migration, 28,439 Quebecers moved away between January and September of 2013—the highest number for that time period in 13 years. </p>

	<p>According to Jack Jedwab, the institute’s vice-president, that number is still smaller than that of 40 years ago and may be more for economic reasons than language or politics as it was in the past. </p>

	<p>However, many in the media speculated that language tensions might have been, once again, one of the main reasons for the departure of so many Quebecers. </p>

	<p>An article titled “More Quebecers are leaving the province” and published on CJAD’s website Jan. 9—the day of the report’s release—linked the statistic to PQ’s rise to power as a minority government.</p>

	<p>The same day, <em>The Gazette</em> published an editorial in which it said it’s very likely the province’s “degraded political climate” is “accelerating the outflow” of Anglophones. </p>

	<p>Last May, Montreal journalist and pundit Dan Delmar penned an opinion piece for the <em>National Post</em> entitled “PQ power gives rise to ‘Angryphone’ lunacy.”</p>

 “Angryphones” are “the most vigorous defenders of linguistic rights,” as Delmar defined the term in the article. And they’re back.

	<p>But they aren’t the only ones outspoken on language rights. In December, the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste, along with over 100 Quebec figures, including former premier Bernard Landry, launched a campaign termed “Uni-e-s contre la francophobie.” The campaign aims at denouncing the alleged unfavourable portrayal of francophones and the province of Quebec in English media, dubbed “Quebec-bashing.”</p>

	<p>As a French-speaking territory located in a country that is predominantly English speaking, and neighbour to one of the most powerful English-speaking countries in the world, Quebec has fought hard to ensure the survival of its official language. The province fights even harder as globalization makes the use of the world’s strongest languages widespread, as French is not included in this category.</p>

	<p>Despite polarizing voices, others have tried to soothe. PQ Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and External Trade Jean-François Lisée is known for reaching out to the Anglo community numerous times, and spoke out against the Office Québécois de la langue française’s initial decision to slap a fine on the St. Laurent Blvd. restaurant Buonanotte for not translating words like “pasta” into French on its menu.</p>

	<p>Delmar says such controversies being blown out of proportion is mainly to blame for the province’s ongoing language issue. </p>

	<p>“If I write about Angryphones every day, if I write about Societe Saint-Jean-Baptiste every day, you get the impression that these two forces are a lot more influential than they really are. A lot of this crisis has been manufactured by the media,” said Delmar.</p>

	<p>“But day-to-day, I think we get along just fine.”</p>

	<p>As for Steve Faguy, copy editor at <em>The Gazette</em>, he says neither the media nor the government is to blame. </p>

	<p>“Ignorance is the real problem,” he wrote in his blog in December. “Ignorance about Quebec, about the French language, about English Canada, about history, about basic human decency and about the facts.”</p>

	<p>As for Steve Faguy, copy editor at <em>The Gazette</em>, he says neither the media nor the government is to blame. </p>

	<p>“Ignorance is the real problem,” he wrote in his blog in December. “Ignorance about Quebec, about the French language, about English Canada, about history, about basic human decency and about the facts.”</p>

			<p>One year after forming a government in an election triggered by tuition protests, the Parti Québécois has launched a debate just as polarizing—if not more so.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The ongoing hearings on the PQ’s values charter show what op-eds on both sides have been claiming since its “leak” in September—that this whole debate is just thinly veiled Islamophobia. </p>

	<p>Considering the PQ formed their government riding the wave of the Maple Spring, we can’t help but feel used.</p>

	<p>The week before the September 2012 election, <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/back-issues/read/volume-33-issue-2" target="_blank">the words “A Deal With the Devil” appeared in block text on our cover</a>. It illustrated a debate we’d had in our meetings leading up to the election: Could a progressive or federalist vote for the PQ without selling out their own values? With the best chance of unseating the Liberals, was a vote for the PQ endangering religious minorities for a tuition freeze?<br />
A plan for a values charter was never hidden by the PQ; it was a clear part of their campaign platform. But what was less clear was how far it would go.</p>

	<p>We’re now in the midst of a public spectacle—250 hours of testimony that, in his opening remarks on the first day of the hearings, Minister Bernard Drainville stated would not change Bill 60’s proposed ban on religious symbols for public sector employees.</p>

	<p>With the latest poll numbers showing that the Marois government is in the best position for a majority since it took office, it now feels like we, as part of the 2012 student movement, were used by a politician wearing a red square when it suited her needs.</p>

	<p>As far as the Maple Spring is concerned, we essentially got what we wanted. Though there are still student groups advocating for free tuition, the 75 per cent increase over five years was cancelled. Instead we saw a less than three per cent increase this year, and tuition increases are now tied to the average household income.</p>

	<p>The special law putting restrictions on the right to demonstrate was also struck down. With both these moves announced the morning after her election, we couldn’t help but feel a sense of victory alongside Pauline, even if we hadn’t voted for her.</p>

	<p>But that sense of victory is long gone, replaced with the bitter truth that the leading party is not capable of seeing the world from outside its <em>pure laine</em> point of view.</p>

	<p>This charter—denounced by the Quebec Bar Association, unions, universities and the province’s own human rights commission—has brought Islamophobia’s ugly head to the forefront of political discourse. It’s allowed the rant of a man pick-pocketed in Morocco, and a woman being “scarred” by walking in a mosque to be part of the public record.</p>

	<p>While the Liberals flounder in trying to come up with their own populist decision, the PQ line hardens.</p>

	<p>As students demanding cancelled tuition hikes, we were catalysts to the PQ’s government, Marois quickly bottling the rage awakened by the strike. The government can argue the charter is meant to represent the secular nature of the state, but that doesn’t change the fact that the province’s religious majority will never be forced to choose between their job and their faith.</p>

	<p>This charter does nothing to protect the people that its supporters claim are subjugated—it just denies them a chance to work in the public sector. It normalizes the persecution of difference in the public sphere.</p>

	<p>This fear of difference is not exclusive to Quebec, but the government is both validating such thinking and giving it a platform. </p>

	<p>It’s why Quebec women’s centres are reporting an increase in verbal and physical attacks against Muslim women since the charter was first introduced in September. It brings Quebec closer to Europe than Canada—in that this country does not have openly anti-Islam political parties.</p>

	<p>That’s something that should be celebrated, but instead civil liberties are being attacked. And we just can’t shake the feeling that we’re in some way complicit.</p>

	<p>The Luftwaffe prolonged their 15-minute catnaps and could no longer coordinate their blitzes; Operation Barbarossa was launched a month behind schedule; and Hitler stopped waking up in time to order from the “early bird” menu at his favourite diner—something historians say moved him to depression.</p>

	<p>Finally, hunkered down in his hideout in April 1945, Hitler received a telegram from Winston Churchill: “You snooze, you lose, bro.”</p>

					<p>The continuing pattern of development and gentrification, particularly in neighbourhoods like St-Henri or Griffintown, has long been a source of conflict between the different parties involved, and in a recent presentation by Concordia urban planning students in the year-long class Urban Laboratory, another area emerged as a significant site of gentrification and unsanctioned condo development.</p>

	<p>It was revealed that in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough, the proportion of rental units has decreased by nearly 20 per cent over the last 22 years—all as a result of condo conversions. The students also found that, on specific streets like St. Andre St., the change has been even more dramatic, shifting from 93 per cent in 1991 to a mere 35 per cent in 2013. </p>

	<p>Analysis from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation reveals that the number of unsold condominiums on the island will likely continue to increase, which would seem to suggest that the need for more condo developments isn’t even there in the first place.</p>

	<p>In theory, the drastic decreases in rentable units in areas like La Petite-Patrie should not exist, as Montreal has had a condo moratorium in place since 1975. That has done little to stop the semi-legal—and often outright illegal—condo conversion that happens across the city. The moratorium applies to the entire city though is not enforced, leading to the disturbing trend of unsanctioned condo development in numerous neighbourhoods.</p>

	<p>The moratorium was initially put in place with the intention of increasing the number of housing units available for purchase rather than rental, while simultaneously trying to maintain a solid base of units available for rental. </p>

	<p>While there are those who support the moratorium, the loopholes that allow for condos to be semi-legally or illegally developed increases the strain being placed on those who cannot, or choose not to, purchase their homes; people who cannot afford to own rather than rent, and people like us—students, who are vulnerable to rental rates and the availability of affordable housing.</p>

	<p>Two separate spheres must be taken into consideration with the moratorium as it stands now—home ownership and the availability of affordable housing available for rent. </p>

	<p>Petite-Patrie, along with places like Griffintown and St-Henri, is being entirely reshaped through gentrification that, coupled with the unregulated moratorium, threatens the socio-economic structures that exist in these areas. Historically places of lower income residents, new developments in these areas force some of the most vulnerable people in the city out as they become unable to afford to live there.</p>

	<p>The city has an inclusionary zoning policy. With such a policy, developers are required to ensure that a certain number of units in a construction project are reserved for affordable housing, but because the policy falls under provincial jurisdiction it becomes difficult to properly enforce.</p>

	<p>As a result, those who cannot afford the lofty condo price tag are left out in the cold.</p>

	<p>The zoning policy as it stands calls for 30 per cent of all new residential housing to be affordable, 15 per cent dedicated to social and community housing and another 15 per cent reserved for units that are either affordable to rent or own. In theory this would provide a significant number of units to those who need them. In reality, it isn’t the case. </p>

	<p>It isn’t hard to see why the inclusionary policy is important; in areas like Petite-Patrie, where a significant number of residents are unemployed or low income, and where many rent, rather than own, their homes, the existence—<i>and</i> enforcement—of such a policy is key to ensuring that residents have a place to hang their hats. </p>

	<p>Perhaps the most promising avenue to changing this would be to grant the city permission to take charge of enforcing the inclusionary policy. Given that the city arguably understands its demographics and its needs better than the provincial government, it’s puzzling as to why it doesn’t already have control over this policy.</p>

	<p>As is the case with many governmental problems, increased transparency and the availability of documents, like those explaining precisely what the moratorium entails, could go a long way in ensuring that tenants are not taken advantage of. If tenants aren’t even aware that such a policy exists, how can they know when they’re being exploited or treated unfairly? </p>

	<p>It’s imperative that the moratorium policy be modified to ensure that the loopholes are closed. There’s no point in maintaining a policy that does little to curb the displacement of residents, but the policy itself should not necessarily be scrapped.</p>

	<p>Instead, policy-makers should focus on closing loopholes like the one permitting building owners to convert rental units into undivided co-ownership spaces—where individuals own portions of the entire property—from which point the property can be converted into divided condominiums with only the approval of the Régie du logement.</p>

	<p>This makes it possible for property owners to convert rental property into something that equates to essentially the same thing as a condo with negligible efforts, indicating a serious flaw in the moratorium. </p>

	<p>The lack of regulation for conversion of rental spaces into these undivided co-ownership spaces represents a troubling disparity in the moratorium; property owners can use the loophole as a way of avoiding red tape, and the end result is the same: lower-income residents being forced out as the rent becomes too high. </p>

	<p>As part of his platform during the mayoral race, Denis Coderre said the city should buy abandoned land and buildings around the island to reserve them for the development of community housing, and that “Montreal must fight inadequate housing using all its powers.” </p>

	<p>It’s a promising start, and it’s time that Coderre acts on it in a meaningful way—something that starts with regaining control over the zoning policy and finding a way to better enforce this moratorium. <br />
After all, what good is a moratorium if the precise thing it’s supposed to quell instead flourishes?</p>

With such a policy, developers are required to ensure that a certain number of units in a construction project are reserved for affordable housing, but because the policy falls under provincial jurisdiction it becomes difficult to properly enforce.</p>

	<p>As a result, those who cannot afford the lofty condo price tag are left out in the cold.</p>

	<p>The zoning policy as it stands calls for 30 per cent of all new residential housing to be affordable, 15 per cent dedicated to social and community housing and another 15 per cent reserved for units that are either affordable to rent or own. In theory this would provide a significant number of units to those who need them. In reality, it isn’t the case. </p>

	<p>It isn’t hard to see why the inclusionary policy is important; in areas like Petite-Patrie, where a significant number of residents are unemployed or low income, and where many rent, rather than own, their homes, the existence—<i>and</i> enforcement—of such a policy is key to ensuring that residents have a place to hang their hats. </p>

	<p>Perhaps the most promising avenue to changing this would be to grant the city permission to take charge of enforcing the inclusionary policy. Given that the city arguably understands its demographics and its needs better than the provincial government, it’s puzzling as to why it doesn’t already have control over this policy.</p>

	<p>As is the case with many governmental problems, increased transparency and the availability of documents, like those explaining precisely what the moratorium entails, could go a long way in ensuring that tenants are not taken advantage of. If tenants aren’t even aware that such a policy exists, how can they know when they’re being exploited or treated unfairly? </p>

	<p>It’s imperative that the moratorium policy be modified to ensure that the loopholes are closed. There’s no point in maintaining a policy that does little to curb the displacement of residents, but the policy itself should not necessarily be scrapped.</p>

	<p>Instead, policy-makers should focus on closing loopholes like the one permitting building owners to convert rental units into undivided co-ownership spaces—where individuals own portions of the entire property—from which point the property can be converted into divided condominiums with only the approval of the Régie du logement.</p>

	<p>This makes it possible for property owners to convert rental property into something that equates to essentially the same thing as a condo with negligible efforts, indicating a serious flaw in the moratorium. </p>

	<p>The lack of regulation for conversion of rental spaces into these undivided co-ownership spaces represents a troubling disparity in the moratorium; property owners can use the loophole as a way of avoiding red tape, and the end result is the same: lower-income residents being forced out as the rent becomes too high. </p>

	<p>As part of his platform during the mayoral race, Denis Coderre said the city should buy abandoned land and buildings around the island to reserve them for the development of community housing, and that “Montreal must fight inadequate housing using all its powers.” </p>

	<p>It’s a promising start, and it’s time that Coderre acts on it in a meaningful way—something that starts with regaining control over the zoning policy and finding a way to better enforce this moratorium. <br />
After all, what good is a moratorium if the precise thing it’s supposed to quell instead flourishes?</p>

			<p>When the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi get started in just under two weeks, Emily Even will be cheering Canada on like the rest of her Stingers women’s hockey teammates.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>But when the Olympics end and the International Ice Hockey Federation World Championship gets underway next April, Even won’t only be cheering a different country on—she’ll be playing for a different one, too. </p>

	<p>A rookie defender for Les Lawton’s women’s hockey team, 19-year-old Netherlands-born Even will don her native country’s colours when she takes to the ice in the six-team <span class="caps">IIHF</span> Women’s World Championship Division 1 Group B tournament, to be held April 6 to April 12 in Latvia, for the chance to secure a spot in the 2018 Winter Olympics.  </p>

	<p>The other teams competing in the group are China, Kazakhstan, Hungary, North Korea, the Netherlands and host Latvia.</p>

	<p>Even, who was born in Leiden, a small town 20 minutes outside of Amsterdam, lived in the Netherlands until 2009, when she was 15. That summer, Even moved with her parents and three siblings to Canada. </p>

	<p>“My father wanted us to come to Montreal and experience Canada for its culture and language to give us the choice later on in life whether we wanted to live in Canada or Holland,” said Even. </p>

	<p>The transition wasn’t easy for Even, explaining that she was unhappy at first and had trouble adjusting to life in Canada. Even said it was only in Grade 10 at Westmount High School that she began forming close friendships. </p>

	<p>But it wasn’t until the following year, when she transferred to Lower Canada College in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, that Even finally adopted her new home as her own. </p>

	<p>“After coming to <span class="caps">LCC</span> for Grade 11, I realized that I loved it here [in Canada] and that I wanted to stay,” said Even.</p>

	<p>The last European-born hockey player for either one of Concordia’s two hockey teams was Cecilia Andersson.</p>

	<p>The Swedish-born goaltender suited up for the Stingers from 2003 to 2006, when she represented her native country in the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Even hopes she’ll get to do the same in 2018. </p>

	<p>“Right now, the Netherlands are 16th worldwide when it comes to world ranking in women’s hockey,” explained Even. </p>

	<p>“And the top seven [ranked] teams go to the Olympics; if we win [the tournament in April] we can move up in the rankings fast.”</p>

	<p>An appearance in the 2018 Olympics would be a first for Even (and her country), who began practicing for the Dutch national team at the tender age of 12 and officially joined the roster when she was 14 years old, playing her first game in a tournament held in France. </p>

	<p>“In Holland, there are only 15 real hockey clubs,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“But the players are all very dedicated to the game, they really want to be there—playing for my home country is still such a huge experience.”</p>

	<p>Even holds dual-citizenship from both the Netherlands and Canada, something she’s made the most of. Despite living on the western side of the Atlantic, she was still invited annually to represent her home country in international tournaments.</p>

	<p>In 2011, she was part of the Dutch team that went to Australia for that year’s <span class="caps">IIHF</span> World Championship and took home the gold medal against the host team. </p>

	<p>The following year she joined the team in England for the tournament’s 2012 edition, and last year, in France, helped lead the team to a silver-medal finish in the competition. </p>

	<p>Even has also played in exhibition tournaments in the Czech Republic and Germany, among other places.</p>

	<p><strong>Life in Montreal</strong></p>

	<p>After graduating high school from <span class="caps">LCC</span> in 2011, Even moved south of the border to play two seasons at a prep school in Millbrook, New York, where she held the title of team captain. </p>

	<p>Upon completing her studies there, she decided to return home to Montreal and enrolled in Concordia’s Leisure Science program.</p>

	<p>Concordia was a natural choice for Even. </p>

	<p>“It was very close to home and they had the program I wanted and a brand new rink,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“They also had a strong hockey program, so it was a win-win-win.”</p>

	<p>For Stingers veteran Jaymee Shell, Even is a welcome addition to the team. </p>

	<p>“She’s a good teammate and she brings a positive energy to the room and to our team,” said Shell. </p>

	<p>“She has a shot that other goalies should fear and I like her style of play.”</p>

	<p>Still just in her first year with the Stingers, Even has many high aspirations that she hopes to accomplish throughout her time sporting the Maroon and Gold.</p>

	<p>“It would be pretty cool to be named All-Canadian at least once,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“I’d like to be a good, solid and consistent defence. And obviously I’d like to complete my bachelor’s [degree] too.”</p>

	<p>Despite having settled in Montreal Even still holds onto her Dutch pride, and has scored in every world championship she’s played in while wearing the orange and blue colors of Holland, a trend she hopes to continue this coming April.</p>

	<p>“I really hope we can level up, and be able to compete at that level,” said Even. </p>

	<p>“I hope I can play a major role and help contribute to my team.”</p>

			<p>The Global Game Jam will take place worldwide this coming weekend. </p>
			
			
			<p>It’s a new year, and what better way to kick off 2014 than with a game jam of worldwide magnitude?</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>This Friday, Jan. 24 at 5:30 p.m., game designers will come together to create games in just 48 hours; a feat of strength to some, and just another weekend for others.</p>

	<p>The Global Game Jam is the largest of its kind in the world, spanning cities in 61 countries, including Montreal. </p>

	<p>Concordia University and École de technologie supérieure (<span class="caps">ETS</span>) are among several locations in the city preparing for this coming weekend’s madness. </p>

	<p>For those unfamiliar with the concept, a game jam is a gathering of writers, artists, programmers, and musicians, who can collaborate or fly solo in the creation of a game within a fixed period of time. </p>

	<p>Typically, there is a theme which participants must attempt to embrace. In September 2013, the Boob Jam took a critical look at the use of breasts in games and attempted to redefine them. October’s <a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/4912"><span class="caps">GAMER</span>ella</a> aimed to promote more women within the games industry. </p>

	<p>Participants can create just about any type of game they like, whether it is a video game, board game, or card game, so long as it meets the criteria of the jam. </p>

	<p>According to TAG’s game jam coordinator, Charlotte Fisher, Concordia has been booked full, nearly doubling last year’s turnout.</p>

	<p>“There&#8217;s a huge boom of interest this year,” she said, “Last year there were 40 people signed up; this year it’s 60 with 14 on the waiting list. [There’s been] an increase in interest [and] we&#8217;re going to try to work toward expansion for next year.”</p>

	<p>Similarly, <span class="caps">ETS</span> has also seen a successful turnout, with a staggering 150 people registered and counting. For those interested in game development, it’s the event of the season. </p>

	<p>“The word is finally spreading and it’s a good thing for developers to stretch their muscles. And it’s great for new people; they&#8217;re getting more confident and interested,” Fisher added.</p>

	<p>For most jams, the theme is available beforehand, allowing participants to think ahead before they hit the grindstone.</p>

	<p>The Global Game Jam is different. At 5:30 p.m., across all time zones, the theme will be released, with Hawaii being the last to find out. </p>

	<p>From there, participants will have 48 hours, stretching from Friday to Sunday to create a game, with the event officially ending at 3 p.m. </p>

	<p>The secret theme poses a unique challenge for participants, as it not only forces teamwork, but tests ingenuity under the pressure of a deadline. </p>

	<p>According to Samuel Simard, president of Conjure, ETS’s scientific student club, it is their largest event of the year. They’ve been preparing since November of last year. </p>

	<p>“You want to jump in and challenge yourself,” he said. “Doing a game jam opens you up beyond the educational environment. [It] allows you meet people from all over, [from] hobbyists to professionals and make contacts.” </p>

	<p>Conjure started back in 2009 and has since grown from 20 members to 80. </p>

	<p>Their interests range from programming to people interested in hardware development. They’ve forged partnerships within the <span class="caps">AAA</span> industry and gained sponsorship from <span class="caps">ETS</span>, Warner Bros., and Electronic Arts to name a few. </p>

	<p>Their club is open to anyone interested in game development and they actively promote creativity. For more information, you can check out their <a href="www.facebook.com/ConjureETS?fref=ts">Facebook page.</a></p>

	<p>For those unable to participate in the Global Game Jam, the <span class="caps">QUILTBAG</span> Jam, hosted by the Pixelles, a Montreal organization which promotes diversity in game-making, will take place on February 8. </p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">QUILTBAG</span> jam will encourage the creation of games featuring queer identities and experiences. Details on the jam can be found on <a href="pixelles.ca/blog/2014/01/quiltbag-jam">Pixelle’s website.</a></p>

	<p>Pixelles will also be providing a game workshop on February 1, encouraging everyone interested in game development (whether they know anything about making games or not) to come join in on the fun. </p>

	<p>Just like any other game jam, participants are reminded to bring equipment with them. </p>

	<p>For those working on the Global Game Jam at the Sir George Williams campus this Friday, space will be provided, along with internet access, and of course, food and drink. </p>

	<p>The event will be located on the 6th floor of the EV building, in room 6720. For more information about getting your game on, check out the details on <a href="tag.hexagram.ca/events/globalgamejam-2014">TAG’s website</a> or the <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org">Global Game Jam’s website.</a></p>

	<p>Conjure started back in 2009 and has since grown from 20 members to 80. </p>

	<p>Their interests range from programming to people interested in hardware development. They’ve forged partnerships within the <span class="caps">AAA</span> industry and gained sponsorship from <span class="caps">ETS</span>, Warner Bros., and Electronic Arts to name a few. </p>

	<p>Their club is open to anyone interested in game development and they actively promote creativity. For more information, you can check out their <a href="www.facebook.com/ConjureETS?fref=ts">Facebook page.</a></p>

	<p>For those unable to participate in the Global Game Jam, the <span class="caps">QUILTBAG</span> Jam, hosted by the Pixelles, a Montreal organization which promotes diversity in game-making, will take place on February 8. </p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">QUILTBAG</span> jam will encourage the creation of games featuring queer identities and experiences. Details on the jam can be found on <a href="pixelles.ca/blog/2014/01/quiltbag-jam">Pixelle’s website.</a></p>

	<p>Pixelles will also be providing a game workshop on February 1, encouraging everyone interested in game development (whether they know anything about making games or not) to come join in on the fun. </p>

	<p>Just like any other game jam, participants are reminded to bring equipment with them. </p>

	<p>For those working on the Global Game Jam at the Sir George Williams campus this Friday, space will be provided, along with internet access, and of course, food and drink. </p>

	<p>The event will be located on the 6th floor of the EV building, in room 6720. For more information about getting your game on, check out the details on <a href="tag.hexagram.ca/events/globalgamejam-2014">TAG’s website</a> or the <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org">Global Game Jam’s website.</a></p>

			<p><i>Ravens and Gaels Shut Out Stingers</i></p>

			<p>Coming off a four-point weekend against Laurentian and Nipissing the week before, Stingers head coach Kevin Figsby and his team knew that this weekend would be a lot tougher, facing off two teams in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport top 10—the Carleton Ravens and the Queen’s Gaels</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>What the Stingers’ men’s hockey team didn’t expect was to get zeroes across the board through both matchups, getting blanked 6-0 Friday night against Carleton and 4-0 the following afternoon versus Queen’s.</p>

	<p>Friday night against the seventh-ranked Ravens saw the return of forward Taylor Lambke, who hadn’t played in a couple of months nursing a foot and shoulder injury.</p>

	<p>“It’s definitely an adjustment coming back, especially with two tough games,” said Lambke. </p>

	<p>“I think we worked harder, more so in the second half of Sunday’s game. It’s been a while [since we’ve] played all together, so it’s going to be nice the rest of the way forward.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers trailed by one after the first period with goaltender Antonio Mastropietro making nine saves. After a melee erupted at the buzzer, Raven Jordan Deagle was given a four-minute double minor for head-butting.</p>

	<p>The Ravens took this opportunity to seal their victory in the game—scoring two power play markers, along with a shorthanded goal to give Carleton the easy victory.</p>

	<p>In the third, and after the Ravens scored their fourth goal, Figsby gave Mastropietro the yank, and let Antoine Marchand get some ice time in nets. Marchand made some key saves, but unfortunately the offense couldn’t get anything started.</p>

	<p>With 3:38 left in the game Concordia forward Jessyco Bernard was awarded a penalty shot, but was denied by Francis Dupuis, who made 20 saves for the shutout.</p>

	<p>Saturday’s afternoon against the Gaels seemed to get off on the wrong skate right away, when off the opening Bernard was assessed a two and a 10-minute misconduct for a hit to the head just 22 seconds into the contest.</p>

	<p>Queens’ opened the score four minutes later when forward Corey Bureau slapped one past Mastropietro.</p>

	<p>The game continued back and forth until the Gaels’ Yannick Laflamme took an interference call at 11:01.</p>

	<p>That man advantage provided opportunity for the Stingers, but it was the Maroon and Gold who paid the ultimate price during their power play. The Gaels showed their dominance, scoring two quick shorthanded goals by Stephane Chabot and Pat McGillis to widen their lead to 3-0 just over 10 minutes into the contest.</p>

	<p>“It really wasn’t part of our game plan today,” said Figsby.</p>

	<p>“Our defence pinched twice, and they’re that good of a team [that] they were able to capitalize both times.”</p>

	<p><a href="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/5099">Stingers standout Olivier Hinse</a> had a close chance shorthanded but just couldn’t get enough wood to fire it past Gaels’ goaltender Chris Clarke, one of his 26 saves in the shutout.</p>

	<p>Hinse was also under the watchful eye of Tampa Bay Lightning scout Michel Boucher throughout the weekend.</p>

	<p>McGillis added his second of the game on the power play late in the frame, scoring with just under two to go on a swift wrist shot right under the crossbar.</p>

	<p>The rest of the game was actually a great one for the Stingers, who poured on the chances, including outshooting Queen’s 13-3 in the third, but just couldn’t beat the Gaels netminder, or complete the perfect pass to get them on the board.</p>

	<p>“We knew before this weekend we were going to face two top 10 teams, two veteran teams,” said Figsby following Sunday’s loss. </p>

	<p>“We were a little bit uncharacteristic today, especially in the first period. We just have to practice all week and be better next weekend.”</p>

	<p>Stingers’ next matchup is this Friday 7:00 p.m. on the road versus the Nipissing Lakers.  </p>

			<p><i>Stingers Bounce Back After Tough Loss to No. 2 CIS Ranked UdeM </i></p>

			<p>With the season edging closer and closer to the February 14 finale, the Concordia Stingers women’s hockey team had a big task ahead of them this weekend.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>First they had a rematch against Canadian Interuniversity Sport’s number 2-ranked team Université de Montreal Carabins at home Thursday evening, and on Sunday afternoon they paid a visit to the Carleton Ice House for a matchup against the host Ravens.</p>

	<p>Despite a valiant showing from every player up and down the Stingers roster, they were unable to equalize the game late against the Carabins and wound up dropping a 3-2 decision. </p>

	<p>Stingers’ goaltender Carolanne Lavoie-Pilon played a solid 60 minutes, turning aside 35 shots in the loss, and 61 of 66 shots on the weekend.</p>

	<p>“Even though we didn’t win the game Thursday, I still believe it gave us a lot of momentum heading into Sunday,” said Lavoie-Pilon. “It really was a show of character.”</p>

	<p>The goals were scored by rookie attacker Kerianne Schofield and sophomore forward Marie-Pier Cloutier. Cloutier, who scored a beauty after stripping the Carabin defender in the Stingers’ zone, broke out leading a three-on-one rush before wiring a sizzler off the post and behind Carabin netminder Élodie Rousseau-Sirois.</p>

	<p>The Stingers had pre-game confidence travelling to the nation’s capital on Sunday, as they had taken three of four from Carleton this season. The Ravens only have one victory this season, a win against Concordia back in the season opener on October 19. The Stingers prevailed this weekend yet again by a count of 3-2 in the shootouts, giving them four wins on the season.</p>

	<p>“I think it was a great bounce-back game from last weekend,” said Stingers head coach Les Lawton. </p>

	<p>“Everybody has been contributing, and we’re really happy with [the] overall team play.”</p>

	<p>The game didn’t quite start on the good skate for the Stingers. Raven forward Sadie Wegner opened the scoring two minutes into the contest when she outbattled a Stinger defence and went upstairs on goaltender Carolanne Lavoie-Pilon.</p>

	<p>A couple of minutes later the Stingers got back on even ground with a power play, when captain Erin Lally took a shot on Ravens’ goaltender Eri Kiribuchi to tie it up.</p>

	<p>Three minutes into the second period Lavoie-Pilon caught a bad break when Carleton rookie Rebecca Klimo got a squeaker to give the Ravens the lead 2-1.</p>

	<p>The Stingers went into the third trailing and knew they had to get a quick goal to keep the momentum on their side.</p>

	<p>Five minutes into the period they caught their break when, on yet another power play, forward Alyssa Sherrard dropped the puck to Jaymee Shell, who wired a wrist shot past Kiribuchi to even the game at two apiece.</p>

	<p>The game stayed solid for both teams with each getting scoring opportunities, including a few close calls on Lavoie-Pilon, who despite her 25 saves in the win tried her hand at puck handling and almost cost her team a couple of times.</p>

	<p>“We’re happy with where she [Lavoie-Pilon] is at now,” said Lawton.</p>

	<p>“Her puck handling skills gave us a few gray hairs behind the bench,” he added with a chuckle.</p>

	<p>In the dying seconds Cloutier almost broke out on her own, but the time had winded down.</p>

	<p>After overtime solved nothing, the game was to be decided in a five-round shootout.</p>

	<p>The first shooter for the Ravens, Wegner, broke in, but was quickly poke-checked by Lavoie-Pilon, once again playing gutsy.</p>

	<p>“I may have had some extra confidence to make some risky moves,” said Lavoie-Pilon.</p>

	<p>“I was really pleased with my performance as well as the team who played in front of me.”</p>

	<p>Shell countered with a beauty shot top shelf, sending cheers along the Stinger bench.</p>

	<p>After Klimo missed, Lally used a pretty deke to undress Kiribuchi and put them ahead by two.</p>

	<p>But the star of the shootout was Lavoie-Pilon, who stopped all four shots she faced in the shootout and help Concordia gain a two-point cushion in the Reseau de sports étudiants au Québec conference.</p>

	<p>“Our goal this weekend was to get ahead of Carleton and stare Ottawa down,” said Shell. “And that’s what we did.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers next game is this Friday night at the <span class="caps">CEPSUM</span> to take on the Carabins yet again. Puck drop is at 7 p.m. </p>

			<p>For Oxford law graduate and impromptu filmmaker Fahim Alam, the last few years have been a hellish ride.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>A few days after the tragic death of English protester Mark Duggan at the hands of police in August 2011, Alam was walking to his grandmother’s place from work through his hometown of Hackney, England.</p>

	<p>Roaming the streets of Hackney wouldn’t be such a daring feat on an ordinary day, but during the harrowing weeks of the London riots, few areas in East London were genuinely safe, and Alam found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

	<p>Alam, along with thousands of others that week, ended up wrongfully thrown into prison after a skirmish with police, accused of hurling bricks at officers. Following his release, the young university graduate was then electronically monitored for six months, adhering to strict curfews while awaiting trial.</p>

	<p>Alam’s reaction to his unjustified imprisonment wasn’t to get angry, however—it was to get constructive. Without any prior film or media knowledge, he picked up a camera and began documenting the London riots on the streets.</p>

	<p>His documentary, <em>Voiceover: Riots Reframed</em>, is the result of his guerrilla tactics, trying to reclaim the viewpoint of the protesters from the mainstream media who made them out to be monsters.</p>

	<p>The feature-length film is being screened all over England and recently made its Canadian debut at Concordia University through non-profit organization Cinema Politica, which primarily screens independent political films.</p>

	<p>The documentary isn’t aimed at any particular audience.</p>

	<p>“The film is simpler than many other documentaries. Any age or social group could understand and gain knowledge from it,” Alam said, while pointing out the importance of history and context in these situations.</p>

	<p>“Tottenham’s riot history goes back to the mid-‘80s after the death of Cynthia Jarrett.”</p>

	<p>Jarrett was a 49-year-old African-Caribbean woman who died of a heart attack while police officers were searching her home for possible items her son may have stolen.</p>

	<p>The following day saw black youth take to the streets, condemning the police as being institutionally racist.</p>

	<p>For Alam, it seems little has changed over a quarter-century later.</p>

	<p>Anyone capable of sifting through the 168 pages of the recently updated “Ministry of Justice: Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System” can plainly see that there are major disparities between the number of arrests and convictions between members of the “white” and “ethnic” communities in the UK.</p>

	<p>Although the document states that “differences [between ethnic groups in the Criminal Justice System] should not be equated with discrimination,” it’s hard to set those suspicions aside in light of London’s history where racism is concerned.</p>

	<p>Alam was determined to showcase mainstream media’s bias through his own lenses.</p>

	<p>“Crime may happen on someone else’s doorstep, but no one gives it much consideration until it reaches the ‘High Streets.’ These days the public receives a very sanitized and segregated version of crime and war from the media,” he said.</p>

	<p>Alam explained how omissions could be just as important as what is being portrayed. But could this possibly change anytime soon?</p>

	<p>“New narratives need to emerge focusing on a new form of propaganda,” he said. “It may take years, but I’m building a new political history and getting through to more and more people.”</p>

	<p>In regards to charters like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada and the Charter of Values that Quebec is trying to introduce, Alam is hesitant in accepting such measures.</p>

	<p>“I believe discrimination will happen regardless of such charters, but what’s more important is to take a look at the colonial past of Quebec and Canada. History breeds these outcomes,” he said.</p>

			<p>What’s for dinner? If you’re walking the pizza- and poutine-paved streets of Montreal, there are endless answers to that question. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>There’s a café catering to every craving. There are establishments, old and new, looking to serve up supper, and competition is stiff.</p>

	<p><strong>From the Crust Up</strong></p>

	<p>So what does it take for a fledgling business to stay above ice water with lemon in a city saturated in resto-bars, patisseries and fine dining experiences? What factors decide whether a new establishment will survive to serve another day or be forced to throw in the apron and emblazon darkened windows with the dreaded red “For Sale” sign?</p>

	<p>“Get back to me in 10 years, and I’ll let you know,” said Brian Szubiak, head chef of Tartufo d’Oro, an Italian restaurant he opened with his brother Kevin in November 2013.</p>

	<p>Tartufo d’Oro is located in the heart of Little Italy, where eateries with encyclopedia-length menus dish up standards like veal parmesan and fettuccini alfredo. It was something the Szubiak brothers decided to avoid when planning their menu.</p>

	<p>“The vision was [taking] something that we knew—Italian cuisine—and doing it in a way that we found fun and exciting, and that you don’t really find anywhere else,” said Brian.</p>

	<p>Besides the curious delights on their menu, which includes riffs on traditional fare such as ravioli stuffed with sweet potato and carrot, pesto sauce made of peppery arugula, and a Nutella and amaretto cookie gelato, the two entrepreneurs insisted that everything had to be done with a meticulous care from the crust up.</p>

	<p>“We make all our own pasta, we make our own focaccia,” said Kevin over the whirring clicks as Brian worked the pasta maker in the background, prepping for dinner service.</p>

	<p>“We make things that meet our ideology—things that we know, ravioli and pesto, and sort of [turn them] into something a little more creative. We don’t find it interesting to recycle the last 30 years,” he said.</p>

	<p>Changing the red sauce and pizza landscape of Little Italy is no easy task, but the brothers are hoping that what sets them apart is what will keep them as a fresh, successful and relevant institution for years to come. </p>

	<p><strong>Some Chess with that Espresso?</strong></p>

	<p>Another up-and-coming business looking to shake pretense is Café Chimera, a board game store and café hybrid in N.D.G.</p>

	<p>Owner and operator Philip Campbell had already been running a game store when he and a business partner decided to move it to a larger location and get into the business of slinging java alongside the games, creating a warm atmosphere where people could come to play and socialize over quality coffee.</p>

	<p>Campbell’s own foray into the realm of coffee is recent. He didn’t even start drinking it until he discovered Third Wave coffee, a movement focused on high-quality beans and developing relationships between growers, roasters and buyers—the microbrewery movement of the caffeine world.</p>

	<p>“I didn’t actually really drink coffee until about two years ago,” he said. “I didn’t know there was good coffee.”</p>

	<p>Thus, one of the prime goals of Chimera is to break down the public’s preconceived notions about what constitutes a good cup of joe by keeping standards of quality high. In Third Wave coffee, it’s common practice to compare the subtle flavours or nuances in a roast, the way one might at a wine tasting. It’s a concept that often doesn’t translate to a large proportion of the public.</p>

	<p>“Originally the baristas would write the flavour notes of the coffee and people thought that meant flavoured coffee. They would write ‘rhubarb’ and people would be like, ‘Rhubarb-flavoured coffee? That sounds disgusting,’” said Campbell.</p>

	<p>Campbell’s philosophy on education may extend to the public, but it begins with his staff. Many of Café Chimera’s baristas were sent to courses to learn about how coffee is made.</p>

	<p>However, a high standard doesn’t necessarily mean high customer traffic. Café Chimera opened in September and has seen its share of struggles since then.</p>

	<p>“We’re still in the process of establishing ourselves,” said Campbell. “We went through a lot of trouble starting up here.</p>

	<p>“Certain spending got out of control,” he continued. “You have to pay people, but then [you] have no money to buy more inventory, and that was our issue early on.” </p>

	<p>Cutbacks on hours and staff are one solution to such a problem, but Campbell sees some of the standards implemented by Revenue Québec as a large contributor to the struggle of new, independent businesses.</p>

	<p>Specifically, he takes issue with the <span class="caps">SRM</span>, or Sales Recording Module, a device attached to cash registers in restaurants and cafés to ensure that restaurant owners do not take liberties when charging clients. It’s a noble goal with some drawbacks, including the large cost it can incur for struggling establishments who may not be able to afford it.</p>

	<p>“The boxes are $600 to $1,000 depending on if you get a new one or a used one. Then you have to pay someone to install it,” Campbell said.</p>

	<p>Such costs might only be the beginning when it comes to the <span class="caps">SRM</span>.</p>

	<p>“There’s people who bought an entirely new [point of sale] system, and then this law came into place and they had to throw [them] out, because they didn’t work with the <span class="caps">SRM</span>,” he said.</p>

	<p>These major costs are a hindrance to independent businesses struggling to survive, whereas they’re only pocket change to the large chain restaurants in Quebec. Strictly speaking, the law might keep business owners honest, but it could very well shut them down while big business thrives. </p>

	<p><strong>Standing the Heat</strong></p>

	<p>A challenge shared by both the Szubiak brothers and Campbell has been handling the red tape that comes with opening a new business.</p>

	<p>“[A challenge] has been finding out all the rules that you don’t really think about, like permits, what you can do in terms of building,” said Kevin. “You need contract workers on it, you can’t just start mucking around.”</p>

	<p>On the other end of the scale, Campbell believes some of the food safety laws need revising.</p>

	<p>“We have to contract out an industrial kitchen to do certain things […] because we don’t have three large sinks,” he said. “We have a sanitizer and everything, [while] some cafés are under a dépanneur licence [and] don’t have to adhere to certain food safety protocol.”</p>

	<p>Perhaps these are necessary evils, but they are also hurdles for busy owners navigating multiple roles. On top of handling administrative affairs, Kevin has been learning food preparation from his brother in order to help out in the kitchen, while Campbell multitasks between café and game store.</p>

	<p>Both Tartufo d’Oro and Café Chimera lean on a close-knit staff to create a warm, knowledgeable atmosphere they hope will be welcome and appealing to customers. They’re both thinking big while keeping it small for now.</p>

	<p>“[We] hire people that would mesh well with the rest of our family. So it’s been a very warm atmosphere thus far,” said Kevin.</p>

	<p>In the meantime, it seems that all either establishment can do is keep pushing forward with sights set on the future, while staying true to their visions.</p>

	<p>Brian cited three key things to focus on to increase their chance of success: “The quality of the food, the quality of the service and a clear direction or concept […] to present to the public.”</p>

	<p>In a few months, the brothers have plans to update Tartufo d’Oro’s menu, to keep themselves and customers interested.</p>

	<p>“Every few months we’re looking to find something new, something more,” said Kevin. “We’re looking to always do something that’s fresh and innovative.” </p>

	<p>One can only hope that the public has an appetite for such food for thought.</p>

	<p>“The boxes are $600 to $1,000 depending on if you get a new one or a used one. Then you have to pay someone to install it,” Campbell said.</p>

	<p>Such costs might only be the beginning when it comes to the <span class="caps">SRM</span>.</p>

	<p>“There’s people who bought an entirely new [point of sale] system, and then this law came into place and they had to throw [them] out, because they didn’t work with the <span class="caps">SRM</span>,” he said.</p>

	<p>These major costs are a hindrance to independent businesses struggling to survive, whereas they’re only pocket change to the large chain restaurants in Quebec. Strictly speaking, the law might keep business owners honest, but it could very well shut them down while big business thrives. </p>

	<p><strong>Standing the Heat</strong></p>

	<p>A challenge shared by both the Szubiak brothers and Campbell has been handling the red tape that comes with opening a new business.</p>

	<p>“[A challenge] has been finding out all the rules that you don’t really think about, like permits, what you can do in terms of building,” said Kevin. “You need contract workers on it, you can’t just start mucking around.”</p>

	<p>On the other end of the scale, Campbell believes some of the food safety laws need revising.</p>

	<p>“We have to contract out an industrial kitchen to do certain things […] because we don’t have three large sinks,” he said. “We have a sanitizer and everything, [while] some cafés are under a dépanneur licence [and] don’t have to adhere to certain food safety protocol.”</p>

	<p>Perhaps these are necessary evils, but they are also hurdles for busy owners navigating multiple roles. On top of handling administrative affairs, Kevin has been learning food preparation from his brother in order to help out in the kitchen, while Campbell multitasks between café and game store.</p>

	<p>Both Tartufo d’Oro and Café Chimera lean on a close-knit staff to create a warm, knowledgeable atmosphere they hope will be welcome and appealing to customers. They’re both thinking big while keeping it small for now.</p>

	<p>“[We] hire people that would mesh well with the rest of our family. So it’s been a very warm atmosphere thus far,” said Kevin.</p>

	<p>In the meantime, it seems that all either establishment can do is keep pushing forward with sights set on the future, while staying true to their visions.</p>

	<p>Brian cited three key things to focus on to increase their chance of success: “The quality of the food, the quality of the service and a clear direction or concept […] to present to the public.”</p>

	<p>In a few months, the brothers have plans to update Tartufo d’Oro’s menu, to keep themselves and customers interested.</p>

	<p>“Every few months we’re looking to find something new, something more,” said Kevin. “We’re looking to always do something that’s fresh and innovative.” </p>

	<p>One can only hope that the public has an appetite for such food for thought.</p>

			<p><i>New Art Exhibit &#8216;Hybrid Bodies&#8217; Examines the Psycho-Social Effects of Heart Transplantation</i></p>

			<p>A haunting image from Andrew Carnie&#8217;s installation titled &#8220;Seized Out of This World.&#8221; </p>
			
			
			<p>No organ in the human body is as coveted as the heart. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>In poetic terms, it is the primal source of our most profound emotions, and can be given to—or shattered by—the ones closest to us. In bio-medical terms, it breathes life into our veins with every faithful beat, and when it ceases to function, we cease to exist.</p>

	<p>But what happens when this highly significant cog of human machinery is passed from one to another in a surgical transplant? Will the recipient forever hear a tell-tale heart drumming in their chest?</p>

	<p>Interdisciplinary artist, Concordia studio arts professor and one of the founders of the Hexagram: Media Arts Institute, Ingrid Bachmann has aimed a philosophical arrow at the idea of the heart—and the emotional and psychological ramifications a transplant between humans can have.</p>

	<p>Bachmann is a participating artist and researcher for <em>Hybrid Bodies</em>, an exhibition linking art and medical science opening on Jan. 22 at the <span class="caps">PHI</span> Centre. She focused her contributing work on the emotional reactions of such a significant gift and the idea of shared boundaries that heart donation involves.</p>

	<p>She stressed how overwhelming the sense of gratitude is among heart transplant recipients, and in an individualistic society such as ours, this feeling of gratitude comes with a certain discomfort and uneasiness.</p>

	<p>“We are a culture that’s very uncomfortable with the notion of ‘gift,’ unlike the First Nations, who entrench giving and reciprocity as a fundamental element of their culture,” Bachmann said. </p>

	<p>“In many ways, the project is personal and individual but there is also a larger part of social and cultural elements on how we talk about death, ownership and gifts.”</p>

	<p>To illustrate her ideas, Bachmann chose to work with Concordia dance students Linnea Gwiazda and Maxine Segalowitz on a filmed performance. For her piece, several video sequences play simultaneously on four different screens, creating an effect of fluidity and movement. Bachmann said the medium of dance illustrates the abstract experience of an internal psychological struggle.</p>

	<p>“I really felt I needed to get out of my comfort zone,” she said. “When things are invisible, such as heart transplants, there is a real complexity about what is perceived and not perceived.<br />
“I wanted to do more abstract performance of language with the body.”</p>

	<p><strong>The Scientific Method</strong></p>

	<p>In 2010, seven doctors and researchers formed a research team known as the Process of Incorporating a Transplanted Heart, and published a pioneering essay called “What They Say Versus What We See: ‘Hidden’ Distress and Impaired Quality of Life in Heart Transplant Recipients” in the <em>Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation</em>.</p>

	<p>Feeling their message could be better received through a different medium, the team approached four international artists to give a voice to their patients’ emotional distress and uncertainties.</p>

	<p>The artists were Bachmann and Catherine Richards from Canada, and Andrew Carnie and Alexa Wright from the U.K. <em>Hybrid Bodies</em> is their collective effort together.</p>

	<p>From multi-channel video installations, to digital three-dimensional photography, sculptural pieces and sound works, <em>Hybrid Bodies</em> offers a wide range of different perspectives and approaches to the complex matter of heart transplants.</p>

	<p>After having studied the video footage of several interviews of patients that have undergone the operation, each artist interpreted and illustrated the issue in their own distinctive ways. To a certain extent, these interpretations reflect the different facets of the emotional coping process that many of them experience.</p>

	<p>Visual artist Richards concentrated her piece, “Charged Hearts,” on the notions of artifact, gratitude and gift giving. She does so through the transformation of the heart as an object, molded into different shapes and built with several materials, such as glass and metal.</p>

	<p>On a different level, Carnie’s work, “Seized Out of this World,” conveys the ideas of vulnerability and far-reaching self-consciousness that he perceived in the different testimonies. His video installation showcases nude human bodies interlocking and creating different organic, biological shapes, shifting as if fluid.</p>

	<p>“Some believe that they take on characteristics of someone else in a sort of vague way [after a heart transplant],” said Carnie. “Even if they’re not, the fact that they’re thinking about it is really important, so they become destabilized. They enter this flux, looking at themselves, thinking about themselves.</p>

	<p>“Them being naked reflects our vulnerability to the whole procedure—we just become something that they’re going to operate on, a clinical object,” he continued. “It had that resonance of that vulnerability.”</p>

	<p>Pushing the metaphor even further, Wright developed her piece, “Heartfelt” around the symbolic meaning of the heart. She merges cultural meanings around the exchange of hearts—love, relationships and emotions—with the literal exchange of hearts implied in the donation.</p>

	<p>Using sound effects, she juxtaposes interviews of people expressing the difficulties they experience with love and relationships with people expressing their emotions following a life-saving heart transplant.</p>

	<p>“Alexa links the symbolic aspect of the heart as the seed of love and its incredible weight in our culture with the physical effect of heartbreak and transplantation,” said Bachmann.</p>

	<p>The artists invite show-goers to draw their own conclusions after visiting the exhibit—you’ll likely find a newfound appreciation for that tireless muscle in your chest upon leaving.</p>

	<p>“We are not looking for facts neither claiming that our work is truth,” Bachmann said. “We only reveal big questions about life, death and identity.”</p>

			<p>Comebacks in sports can be physically and emotionally draining on not just athletes, but on their coaches, too. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>After the Stingers’ comeback against the Laval Rouge et Or on Saturday, no one looked more relieved than longtime head coach John Dore.</p>

	<p>During the post-game interview with Stinger point guard Adam Chmielewski and shooting guard Jean-Andre Moussignac, Dore couldn’t help but interrupt to express his gratitude to his players.</p>

	<p>“These guys are my heroes,” said Dore, much to the delight of the two players.</p>

	<p>Despite being behind for most of the game—by as many as 13 points in the third quarter—Concordia’s men’s basketball team pulled themselves together and kept their winning streak alive in a thrilling 62-57 victory over Laval on Saturday evening, sweeping their home-and-home series with a 73-63 final over the Rouge et Or on the road two nights prior. </p>

	<p>“It was a really gutsy win for us,” said Dore. “I thought we executed really well down the stretch, we did what we had to do to win the game.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers’ comeback began in the fourth quarter, down 55-47, when forward Michael Fosu scored as he was fouled. His free throw completed a three-point play, making him the catalyst of a 11-0 run.</p>

	<p>One of Dore’s “heroes” Chmielewski was a key player in the Stingers riposte, coming alive in the fourth quarter after a quiet first half. He finished the game with 12 points and eight rebounds, including a three-point shot that gave Concordia the lead. </p>

	<p>“I felt [our] team came out flat at the start, but we knew we were ready to play once we felt the sense that the game was slipping away,” said Chmielewski. </p>

	<p>After beginning the season 0-3, the Stingers have since won five games in a row, and have yet not lost in 2014. Moussignac, who scored 10 points and had five rebounds, says his team—filled with new personnel and players stepping into new roles—are finally starting to gel.</p>

	<p>“Over the break, we practiced a lot,” he said. “We had more time to focus on every little detail. And it [paid] off, as you can see. We’re doing much better.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers don’t have much time to enjoy their victory, as they’ll prepare for a significant rivalry matchup this Thursday versus the league-leading McGill Redmen. The game is at McGill, and tipoff is at 8 p.m. </p>

			<p>The Concordia Stingers women’s basketball team was fully aware that the Laval Rouge et Or were likely going to respond from a previous beat-down, 60-36, handed to them two days earlier in their own building. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>While the Stingers could not replicate another blowout over Laval, they still left the court with the same result as Thursday night—a win.</p>

	<p>The Stingers started off slow, but were still able to hold off Laval, winning 58-50 and sweeping a home and home series. Marilyse Roy-Viau led all players in points, scoring 18 and grabbing seven rebounds. Concordia have now won four of their last five league games.</p>

	<p>“We blew them out pretty bad [on Thursday] so we knew they were going to come hungry,” said point guard Ashley Clarke, who scored 10 points and grabbed six rebounds in Saturday’s contest.  </p>

	<p>The Stingers only scored eight points in the opening quarter. Fortunately for them, Laval only responded with seven. Soon after, both teams kept it close, with no lead by either team being bigger than five points until late in the fourth quarter, in contrast to last Thursday night’s encounter, where the Stingers ran away with the lead from the first basket.</p>

	<p>Overshadowing the win, however, was a bizarre incident near the end of the fourth quarter, where Stingers forward Serginha Estime emerged from a scramble with a Laval player with the ball, while the Laval player claimed Estime bit her, yelling to the referees. Estime was assessed a foul, but not a technical, yet was ejected with over 3 minutes to play in the fourth.</p>

	<p>When asked about it, Estime denied biting the player, while Stingers’ head coach Keith Pruden wasn’t aware it had happened. Pruden said he was “disappointed” that Estime got ejected, but wasn’t overly concerned about not having Estime on the floor, replacing her with Tina Mpondani.</p>

	<p>Pruden acknowledged his team’s errors, and knew that Laval would play to erase the embarrassment of Thursday night, yet credited his own team for getting the job done.</p>

	<p>“In the second half, we showed a great deal of composure,” Pruden said. “We showed a great deal of competitiveness and we found a way to win the game.</p>

	<p>“That’s the mark of a team that can win a championship. You find a way to win, even when you’re not playing well, and we did not play well.”</p>

	<p>The Stingers’ next challenge is a home and home series against their rival, and league-leading McGill Martlets, starting next Thursday at home, before playing at McGill on Saturday.</p>

			<p><i>Concordia Undergrads Find Rental Housing  Decreasing in La Petite-Patrie Due to Condo Conversions</i></p>

			<p>“Gentrification” has become a buzzword in working-class-turned-hip neighbourhoods across Montreal, from St-Henri to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Some equate gentrification with the renewal of run-down inner-city areas, while others fear that it transforms poorer neighbourhoods beyond recognition, thereby alienating longtime residents and leading to their displacement as rents and property values skyrocket.</p>

	<p>It’s no surprise, then, that gentrification polarizes opinion. In Montreal, the tensions between “gentrifiers” and “gentrified” have sometimes gotten heated, with spray-painted anti-capitalist slogans finding their way onto billboards advertising new condo developments and on businesses’ displays. </p>

	<p>Occasionally, reactions to gentrification have been even more extreme. Last November, vandals in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve smashed the windows of four upscale restaurants in the neighbourhood. In 2004, another anti-gentrification group planted six packages disguised as bombs at condo construction sites in the city’s East End.</p>

	<p>Last week, 25 Concordia undergraduates and their professor waded into the turbid gentrification debate. They put in roughly 2,000 hours of research last semester to determine how gentrification is affecting the little neighbourhood of La Petite-Patrie. They unveiled their findings at a press conference last Thursday.</p>

	<p>A moratorium on condo conversions was introduced nearly 40 years ago, but that hasn’t stemmed the gentrifying tide. The Concordia research study shows a steady decline in the availability of rental housing as more and more triplexes are being turned into condominiums. </p>

	<p><strong>The Research</strong></p>

	<p>No matter which side you’re on in the gentrification debate, the study’s findings are surprising: they show the proportion of rental units in La Petite-Patrie has decreased from 96 per cent of units in 1991 to 77 per cent of units in 2013.</p>

	<p>The study, led by Concordia professor Ted Rutland, also found that gentrification has affected some blocks more than others.</p>

	<p>Take St. André St., for example. The proportion of buildings offering rental accommodations dropped from 93 per cent, or 150 buildings, in 1991 to 35 per cent, or 57 buildings, last year.</p>

	<p>The students arrived at these numbers by analyzing 3,401 triplexes in the district, using government databases. The study was conducted in partnership with the Comité logement de la Petite-Patrie, a local tenant rights organization.</p>

	<p>“[The research project] comes out of the tradition of trying to treat the city as a learning space [&#8230;] but also contributing to it,” Rutland said.</p>

	<p>Not only did the study find a reduction in access to rental housing, it also shows that nearly half of condo conversions in La Petite-Patrie use the undivided co-ownership model, while the other half used the divided co-ownership model.</p>

	<p>Under undivided co-ownership, a building is owned collectively by all of its residents, with each resident owning a percentage of the whole building. The units aren’t divided into separate lots, but a management agreement may stipulate which unit is to be used by each resident.</p>

	<p>In contrast, divided co-ownership seeks to financially and legally separate each owner. Each resident owns only the specific unit they live in, as well as certain common areas like a backyard. This model is the one typically used in newly built condominium complexes.</p>

	<p>Undivided properties were traditionally seen as a riskier investment, as lenders previously offered only one mortgage for the entire building—linking the financial futures of each co-owner. </p>

	<p>Today, however, some lenders will provide individual mortgages to each co-owner, and insurance protects the co-owners in the event that one of them should be unable to pay their mortgage. Because taxes are calculated based on the whole property’s value, co-owners in an undivided building also pay lower taxes.</p>

	<p>In 1975, the provincial government implemented a moratorium on the conversion of apartment buildings into condominiums using the divided co-ownership model. The goal was to preserve the amount of rental housing available, reducing the vulnerability of renters.</p>

	<p>The moratorium remains in place in Montreal to this day, though the students’ research calls into question its effectiveness as government policy. The moratorium does not regulate the conversion of a rental property into an undivided condo building, which is now as common a form of co-ownership as divided properties are.</p>

	<p>Rutland said the ease of turning a rental property into undivided condos is one of the mechanisms through which gentrification is taking place in the neighbourhood while going almost entirely unnoticed by residents.</p>

	<p>“Most of us who live in a gentrifying neighbourhood would notice if they tore down a bunch of buildings and built new condos, or if they built new condos in a previously vacant lot—it’s very visible,” he said.</p>

	<p>“But the conversion to [undivided co-ownership] is something that happens behind the walls of buildings. Sometimes, it’s just a change in legal structure where, all of a sudden, a triplex that was rented out to three tenants is [&#8230;] in co-ownership and you don’t see anything.”</p>

	<p>Martin Blanchard of the Comité logement de la Petite-Patrie says the moratorium currently in place is ineffective because it doesn’t address the undivided co-ownership model.</p>

	<p>“A solution would be that undivided ownership stays as undivided ownership, not to create some type of pseudo-divided ownership in undivided ownership,” he said, referring to the protections and benefits that co-owners in an undivided building now enjoy.</p>

	<p>“It’s kind of fiscally unfair that people who have a divided condo pay much more tax than people who are in the undivided condos, while [in terms of] the market value, these [properties] are almost the same.”</p>

	<p><strong>The Pros and Cons of Gentrification</strong></p>

	<p>But should we be truly concerned by gentrification? Opinions are mixed on whether gentrification is a positive or negative phenomenon.</p>

	<p>“You’ll hear people talk about gentrification when they’re generally on the negative side of the issue, and you’ll hear people talk about economic revitalization if they’re more positive about it,” says Concordia professor Peter Morden of the rhetoric involved in the debate.</p>

	<p>In addition to displacing the residents of traditionally disadvantaged neighbourhoods through higher property values and rents, he notes that one of the negative consequences of gentrification is “greater pressure on the social infrastructure, [such as] ballparks and community centres, when there are a couple of competing groups for those kinds of spaces.”</p>

	<p>“Is it the case that not-for-profit youth sports [are] offered? Or is it the case that there are seniors’ leagues for some of the gentrifying population that would be willing to pay for the ice time? These kinds of competitions for scarce public resources can come up as well,” he said.</p>

	<p>But gentrification may also have some positive consequences on neighbourhoods, says McGill University urban planning professor Raphaël Fischler.</p>

	<p>“It diversifies the economic base of the neighbourhood with different stores, restaurants and cafés,” he said. “A wider range of services becomes available. Some of them are not accessible to the population that was there before because of price differences, but overall, it enlivens the neighbourhood to a certain extent. It brings more people into the neighbourhood, more activity.”</p>

	<p>Fischler also noted that gentrification can benefit cities’ coffers, as higher property values lead to more tax revenue. The neighbourhood’s physical infrastructure may also be improved either to set gentrification in motion or to respond to the needs of the population moving in, he said.</p>

	<p>Investments in infrastructure should be made regardless of whether or not an area is undergoing gentrification, however, argues Fred Burrill of P.O.P.I.R. &#8211; Comité Logement, an association of tenants in Montreal’s Sud-Ouest borough, which includes gentrifying areas such as St-Henri.</p>

	<p>“I think that the argument that people make for gentrification is that it brings with it a certain emphasis on green space and a building-up of the neighbourhood in terms of infrastructure, but those are things that should be done anyway,” he said. </p>

	<p>“I think it’s important to break the link between gentrification and positive public investment.”</p>

	<p>According to P.O.P.I.R. &#8211; Comité Logement, the solution to the problems caused by gentrification lies in building more social housing.</p>

	<p>“We think that, in fact, the private market can’t solve the housing crisis, can’t meet the needs of the vast majority of low-income people who need housing, and that the only thing that can do that is the widespread construction of subsidized social housing,” said Burrill.</p>

	<p>But for Annick Germain, a professor and researcher in the field of urban sociology at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique, the contemporary debate on gentrification and research into the topic largely misses the mark.</p>

	<p>She said the term “gentrification” and its French-language equivalent “embourgeoisement” have been co-opted by individuals involved in an ideological debate and are no longer useful as a subject of academic analysis.</p>

	<p>“These are notions that help groups make demands, and I find that it’s no longer a concept that is as useful as it used to be for doing research,” she said. “We put under the terms ‘gentrification’ and ‘embourgeoisement’ a ton of phenomena that are very different.”</p>

	<p>Historically, she says, a lot of working-class people were indeed displaced by gentrification as other social classes moved into their neighbourhoods and property values rose. </p>

	<p>“But today, things are more complicated and it’s reductionist to classify everything that’s going on in formerly working-class neighbourhoods under the term ‘gentrification,’” she continued.</p>

“The most important tool that you have to work with is yourself […] the more you know about yourself, the more useful you can be. I’m a leader, and I know that about myself,” Kowaluk explained. </p>

	<p>She says her training as a social worker allowed her to understand her strengths and weaknesses, and this, she continued, let her give her utmost to the causes close to her heart. </p>

	<p>Kowaluk stressed to the students that the most simple and legal techniques of organizing, such as petitions, protests, letters to the editor and going door to door, are often the most effective. </p>

	<p>The Milton Park Housing Project is Kowaluk’s most celebrated success. When a developer purchased the property in 1979 and wanted to demolish the community of Victorian houses to build modern buildings, Kowaluk worked with the community to prevent the large-scale destruction. The project is now the largest housing co-operative in North America. </p>

	<p>In the discussion period that followed the lecture, students asked for advice for any issue they were having difficulty making progress with. </p>

	<p>The topic of gentrification came up several times, and Kowaluk discussed strategies with other activists in attendance for dealing with the issue. </p>

	<p>On the topic of rising rents that push communities towards the city’s periphery, Kowaluk said, </p>

	<p>“The students studying at McGill are a major problem,” she said, referencing the rising rents caused by concentrated student habitation in the “McGill Ghetto” neighbourhood situated between the university’s campus and the Plateau. </p>

	<p>Kowaluk also recounted her encounter with Cesar Chavez in the late &#8217;60s at a cocktail party. </p>

	<p>“There’s only one way to organize people, and that’s one at a time,” she recalled him saying, which she added has stuck with her throughout her career.</p>

			<p>This weekend, the MainLine Theatre is playing host to a theatrical double feature with deep Concordian roots. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The theatre will be showcasing two new plays, <em>Ivory Towers</em> and <em>Will-o-Wisps</em> by writer, director and actor Michael Martini, who also happens to be a Theatre student at Concordia. </p>

	<p>Although he has a background in acting (Martini plays the princely protagonist in <em>Will-o-Wisps</em>) from a performing arts school in Toronto, Martini said he always held some fascination with the written word, even while studying the craft of performing.</p>

	<p>“I would skip class and read plays instead,” Martini said, “I remember specifically reading <em>Lion in the Streets</em> on a whim, and immediately after that I couldn’t stop writing scenes.” </p>

	<p>The upcoming weekend is a hallmark event, because although both plays have been written and re-written in years past, this is the first time they will be presented in a more official venue and environment.</p>

	<p>“I’ve presented my writing here and there and directed a bit, but never on the scale of a professional show, so this production is definitely a monument for me,” Martini added.</p>

	<p>The plays are 20 minutes apiece, and will be put on back-to-back.</p>

	<p><em>Ivory Towers</em> centers around five female linguistics professors in a battle of words, seeing who can draw on the most thesaurus entries. Razor sharp wit required.</p>

	<p><em>Will-o-Wisps</em> takes place on the prom night of a young prince, locked away and waiting for his knight errant to come and rescue him. To keep him company, he has his imaginary friend, Dinah, who just happens to be an Academy Award-winning movie star.</p>

	<p>Martini himself isn’t the only Concordian involved, either.</p>

	<p>“I’m thrilled that people will see some of my ideas come to my life, but absolutely everyone involved—the actors, the designers—are establishing a presence [as well]. Most of the show’s designers are first year students, and the work they’ve done is incredible.”</p>

	<p>Beyond the upcoming theatrics of the weekend, Martini has an eye on continuing to work and contribute to the landscape of independent and student theatre in Montreal.</p>

	<p>He hopes that the pieces will resonate with enough meaning to result in both a pleased audience, and fuel demand and excitement over future productions. </p>

	<p>“We want to keep the blood of student theatre pumping in the city,” he said, “It’s important for me that <em>Ivory Towers</em> is an ensemble of five female characters, and that Will-o-Wisps has a gay protagonist. This isn’t something we get in the academic setting, and [is] something that I hope our peers will be proud to see happening.”</p>

			<h3>Despite promises during the Concordia Student Union elections in March 2013 that the long-awaited Hive Café would already be up and running by now, students will have to wait until the next academic year to see a student-run café open its doors on the Loyola campus.</h3>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p><br />

<span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Loyola Crystal Harrison said the Hive would be open in some capacity in September 2013 during the election campaign period last March, before being voted into office. Then, in August of last year, the <span class="caps">CSU</span> announced the café’s opening would be delayed until this month.</p>

	<p>But construction on the space hasn’t yet begun—and isn’t expected to begin for several more weeks. </p>

	<p>Electrical, mechanical and architectural drawings will be finalized this month, after which the university will conduct a public tendering process, allowing companies to place bids for the construction contract. A contract with the winning bidder should be signed towards the end of February or early March, with construction then taking place throughout March.</p>

	<p>Delays have plagued The Hive Café project for years. The Loyola Luncheon—a <span class="caps">CSU</span>-sponsored meal program offering students a free, vegetarian-friendly lunch five days a week—has used the space slated for the café since it became available again following renovations in September 2007. </p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> came close to launching a full café in the space in 2010, only to see their plan fall apart upon the discovery that the café’s electrical consumption would exceed the building’s capacity.</p>

	<p>Despite the project’s failings in past years, this year’s <span class="caps">CSU</span> executives nevertheless say they are confident the café will be ready for a launch next fall.</p>

	<p>In an interview with <em>The Link</em> on Monday, Harrison said she was led to believe that the electrical upgrades needed to accommodate The Hive Café’s appliances had already been made. She later found out that wasn’t the case.</p>

	<p>“In terms of the actual construction not moving forward, I don’t know why it was so held up,” she said of the electrical work that was supposed to have already taken place.</p>

	<p>“They need to increase the voltage in order to be able to handle the equipment that we’re installing,” she explained, noting that the university is “paying for and taking care of most of it.”</p>

	<p>The rest of the construction, set to take place in March, should be completed quickly, according to Harrison.</p>

	<p>“It’s not that big of a project,” she said. “It’s a couple of counters and the proper installation of all the equipment. The actual building part won’t take very long.”</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> leases the space for The Hive Café from Concordia. Construction must therefore be arranged through the university’s Facilities Management services.</p>

	<p>“Everyone that I’ve worked with from the university has been super helpful and is really pushing for this as much as they possibly can,” Harrison said, “but it’s my understanding that they also have a lot of other projects that they’re working on, so to throw another one on this architect’s lap and this project manager’s lap—they’re already dealing with so many. […] Sometimes things can take a while on their end.”</p>

					<p>The Hive’s kitchen was already overhauled at a cost of $80,000 in October 2010, when an industrial-sized oven, stove and dishwasher were installed. With most of the construction therefore taking place outside the kitchen, Harrison said the Loyola Luncheon should only minimally be disrupted by the upcoming renovations.</p>

	<p>“It should not directly interrupt [the luncheon] most of the time,” Harrison said. “There will be probably a week or so where they have to shut off electricity or shut off water, in which case that will definitely affect it, so right now I’m looking into alternatives for what to do during that time, because I don’t want to stop feeding students […] even if we can’t use that space.”</p>

	<p>While the construction should end before the summer break, Harrison said the <span class="caps">CSU</span> won’t be hiring employees and opening the café this semester. </p>

	<p>“For us, it doesn’t really make sense to hire somebody to be the manager [of the café] for a month and then not have them working over the summer,” she said, adding that the Hive remaining open likely wouldn’t be profitable during the first summer of business.</p>

	<p>She said there’s a possibility that the <span class="caps">CSU</span> might hold a launch party this academic year, however.</p>

	<p>“If we’re launching, it’s because this has been built,” she said, looking down at the blueprints on her desk in the <span class="caps">CSU</span> offices. “We’re not going to launch anything unless the physical infrastructure is there.</p>

	<p>“It’s looking like next year we’ll be able to be fully operational, so [for the remainder of the current executive’s mandate] we’ll just have to celebrate the fact that we built it at least and set everything in stone so that it can start strong next year,” she continued.</p>

	<p>After the construction is done, Harrison said the next major step is hiring a manager who understands how so-called “solidarity co-operatives” work, as that is the model that has been chosen for the café’s organizational structure.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Sustainability Benjamin Prunty told <em>The Link</em> that the composition of the café’s Board of Directors hasn’t been finalized yet, although he says progress is being made. The café’s manager would likely sit on the Board, he said, while other members might include student staff members and users of the café.</p>

	<p>“Having people who are still going to be committed to the project, even when our mandate is over, is going to be crucial to making [the co-operative] operate the way we want it to,” Harrison said, adding that she’d like to stay involved in the project even after her year as VP Loyola comes to an end, perhaps as a member of the organization’s Board.</p>

	<p>When the Hive does open in the fall, it will take over the responsibility of providing free meals to students from the Loyola Luncheon, Harrison continued.</p>

	<p>“This is the last year the Luncheon is operating as is,” she said. “From here on out, it’s gone essentially, but the <span class="caps">CSU</span> is going to continue to subsidize The Hive Café solidarity co-operative to still offer a free lunch every day.</p>

	<p>“It will be looking quite a bit different [from the Luncheon], but it will actually be more cost-effective for the <span class="caps">CSU</span>.”</p>

	<p>The café will serve pre-packaged food at the beginning because wages for preparation work would be costly, according to Harrison, but the café’s menu will evolve with students’ wishes.</p>

	<p>“There’s room to grow and change according to what students want and need,” she said, adding that there will be sufficient counter space for additional appliances.</p>

	<p>“What’s most important about this project, and what I would like to emphasize, is that something needs to go in this year to fill the food void that exists at Loyola,” Prunty said, adding that the co-operative model will allow the café to adapt to the specifications that the Concordia community will set for it.</p>

	<p>“The initial phase is by no means the final product,” he said. “Once the kitchen is fully useable and once there is a chef for that location, you’d be able to have more input over where the food is coming from.” </p>

	<p>But construction on the space hasn’t yet begun—and isn’t expected to begin for several more weeks. </p>

	<p>Electrical, mechanical and architectural drawings will be finalized this month, after which the university will conduct a public tendering process, allowing companies to place bids for the construction contract. A contract with the winning bidder should be signed towards the end of February or early March, with construction then taking place throughout March.</p>

	<p>Delays have plagued The Hive Café project for years. The Loyola Luncheon—a <span class="caps">CSU</span>-sponsored meal program offering students a free, vegetarian-friendly lunch five days a week—has used the space slated for the café since it became available again following renovations in September 2007. </p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> came close to launching a full café in the space in 2010, only to see their plan fall apart upon the discovery that the café’s electrical consumption would exceed the building’s capacity.</p>

	<p>Despite the project’s failings in past years, this year’s <span class="caps">CSU</span> executives nevertheless say they are confident the café will be ready for a launch next fall.</p>

	<p>In an interview with <em>The Link</em> on Monday, Harrison said she was led to believe that the electrical upgrades needed to accommodate The Hive Café’s appliances had already been made. She later found out that wasn’t the case.</p>

	<p>“In terms of the actual construction not moving forward, I don’t know why it was so held up,” she said of the electrical work that was supposed to have already taken place.</p>

	<p>“They need to increase the voltage in order to be able to handle the equipment that we’re installing,” she explained, noting that the university is “paying for and taking care of most of it.”</p>

	<p>The rest of the construction, set to take place in March, should be completed quickly, according to Harrison.</p>

	<p>“It’s not that big of a project,” she said. “It’s a couple of counters and the proper installation of all the equipment. The actual building part won’t take very long.”</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> leases the space for The Hive Café from Concordia. Construction must therefore be arranged through the university’s Facilities Management services.</p>

	<p>“Everyone that I’ve worked with from the university has been super helpful and is really pushing for this as much as they possibly can,” Harrison said, “but it’s my understanding that they also have a lot of other projects that they’re working on, so to throw another one on this architect’s lap and this project manager’s lap—they’re already dealing with so many. […] Sometimes things can take a while on their end.”</p>

					<p>The Hive’s kitchen was already overhauled at a cost of $80,000 in October 2010, when an industrial-sized oven, stove and dishwasher were installed. With most of the construction therefore taking place outside the kitchen, Harrison said the Loyola Luncheon should only minimally be disrupted by the upcoming renovations.</p>

	<p>“It should not directly interrupt [the luncheon] most of the time,” Harrison said. “There will be probably a week or so where they have to shut off electricity or shut off water, in which case that will definitely affect it, so right now I’m looking into alternatives for what to do during that time, because I don’t want to stop feeding students […] even if we can’t use that space.”</p>

	<p>While the construction should end before the summer break, Harrison said the <span class="caps">CSU</span> won’t be hiring employees and opening the café this semester. </p>

	<p>“For us, it doesn’t really make sense to hire somebody to be the manager [of the café] for a month and then not have them working over the summer,” she said, adding that the Hive remaining open likely wouldn’t be profitable during the first summer of business.</p>

	<p>She said there’s a possibility that the <span class="caps">CSU</span> might hold a launch party this academic year, however.</p>

	<p>“If we’re launching, it’s because this has been built,” she said, looking down at the blueprints on her desk in the <span class="caps">CSU</span> offices. “We’re not going to launch anything unless the physical infrastructure is there.</p>

	<p>“It’s looking like next year we’ll be able to be fully operational, so [for the remainder of the current executive’s mandate] we’ll just have to celebrate the fact that we built it at least and set everything in stone so that it can start strong next year,” she continued.</p>

	<p>After the construction is done, Harrison said the next major step is hiring a manager who understands how so-called “solidarity co-operatives” work, as that is the model that has been chosen for the café’s organizational structure.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Sustainability Benjamin Prunty told <em>The Link</em> that the composition of the café’s Board of Directors hasn’t been finalized yet, although he says progress is being made. The café’s manager would likely sit on the Board, he said, while other members might include student staff members and users of the café.</p>

	<p>“Having people who are still going to be committed to the project, even when our mandate is over, is going to be crucial to making [the co-operative] operate the way we want it to,” Harrison said, adding that she’d like to stay involved in the project even after her year as VP Loyola comes to an end, perhaps as a member of the organization’s Board.</p>

	<p>When the Hive does open in the fall, it will take over the responsibility of providing free meals to students from the Loyola Luncheon, Harrison continued.</p>

	<p>“This is the last year the Luncheon is operating as is,” she said. “From here on out, it’s gone essentially, but the <span class="caps">CSU</span> is going to continue to subsidize The Hive Café solidarity co-operative to still offer a free lunch every day.</p>

	<p>“It will be looking quite a bit different [from the Luncheon], but it will actually be more cost-effective for the <span class="caps">CSU</span>.”</p>

	<p>The café will serve pre-packaged food at the beginning because wages for preparation work would be costly, according to Harrison, but the café’s menu will evolve with students’ wishes.</p>

	<p>“There’s room to grow and change according to what students want and need,” she said, adding that there will be sufficient counter space for additional appliances.</p>

	<p>“What’s most important about this project, and what I would like to emphasize, is that something needs to go in this year to fill the food void that exists at Loyola,” Prunty said, adding that the co-operative model will allow the café to adapt to the specifications that the Concordia community will set for it.</p>

	<p>“The initial phase is by no means the final product,” he said. “Once the kitchen is fully useable and once there is a chef for that location, you’d be able to have more input over where the food is coming from.” </p>

The annual John Molson <span class="caps">MBA</span> International Case Competition returned last week for its 33rd edition. The world’s oldest and largest case competition saw Concordia’s John Molson School of Business play host to 35 of the world’s most elite business schools for six days.</p>

	<p>Although <span class="caps">JMSB</span> did not win the competition—the University of Minnesota came away with first place—it still managed to break ground.</p>

	<p>“We are the first [case competition] ever to have a customized IT system to run the whole competition, from registration of volunteers and judges to calculating results and integrating results,” said organizer Leila Mosalaeepour.</p>

	<p>It may not sound like a huge leap forward, but fellow organizer Elliott Altilia says the change was like bringing case competitions from the 19th century to the present.</p>

	<p>Even the use of digital tools like PowerPoint presentations were not welcomed warmly at first by all competition participants this year, added Altilia, who coordinated volunteers and cases.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">JMSB</span> and 35 other teams were challenged over the course of the week in several cases—true-to-life business scenarios presented by past competition winners and companies.</p>

	<p>Over five days, 216 students competed for a $10,000 cash prize in hopes of taking home the Concordia Cup.</p>

	<p>Former Canadian governor general Michaëlle Jean presented this year’s live case, a real-life situation unveiled at the same time to all 36 teams.<br />
Jean’s appearance prompted the organizers to adjust the live-case format.</p>

	<p>“Usually, the presenter of the case is not announced until the day of the competition. This year, because of the notoriety of our presenter, we decided to disclose that Michaëlle Jean would be this year’s presenter,” said Altilia.</p>

	<p>The live case centred around the privatizing of Haiti’s power grid, something that is in the process of being debated right now in the Caribbean nation.</p>

	<p>According to Altilia, the real-world implications of the case gave teams the chance to offer solutions that could be used in Haiti in the future. Atilia explained that the case’s presenters, which included Jean and Haiti’s minister of energy security, René Jean-Jumeau, received each presentation on a <span class="caps">USB</span> stick with the hope that the information collected could provide new ideas for possible solutions.</p>

	<p>“I think you will be making such a difference for Haiti, this gathering is timely like you can’t imagine, it’s great,” said Jean, <br />
UNESCO’s special envoy for Haiti, in her opening address to students on Monday. </p>

	<p><strong>Real-World Partnerships</strong></p>

	<p>Canada’s former governor general wasn’t the only high profile speaker present at the competition. A tradition of case competitions is to introduce businesses to upcoming talent, and at the competition banquet it was Michel Ouellette, Bombardier’s president of customer services and specialized and amphibious aircraft, who gave the closing keynote address.</p>

	<p>In an interview with <em>The Link</em>, Ouellette said the case competition allows Bombardier and others to pitch their worth as a company and find potential future leaders among the competition’s participants—and at <span class="caps">JMSB</span> in general. </p>

	<p>“The same way we’re such innovators in terms of what we do in everything we’ve put out in past years, the same openness exists within the company for leadership,” Ouellette said. </p>

	<p>“So if you’re ready to transform yourself as a leader and grow, Bombardier’s a company that’s going to listen to that and give you the chances.”</p>

	<p>According to Ouellette, case competitions are important practice, preparing students for the real risks involved in business and making them ready to embrace last-minute change.</p>

	<p>“One thing that really resonated with me is [when] I went to shake hands with the winning team […] one of their players did not make it in time, they had to have a replacement,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“And you wonder—one person is out, one person replaced—how do you win? And actually, it becomes an advantage. Through change came a great opportunity.”</p>

	<p>By allowing important lessons to be learned through a simulation, Ouellette said he believes the experience becomes invaluable to a future in business management.</p>

	<p>“No one loses, because if you participate in this thing, you’re bound to be with people of great mind and energy and that’s going to bring you something,” said Ouellette.</p>

	<p>“You learn different things about leadership throughout the years, but one of the key things is being in an environment that is stimulating, so coming to the case competition, that’s what it’s going to give you.”</p>

	<p>Despite not making it past the opening round, Ridge Foster of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz Graduate School of Business said the experience itself produced its own rewards.</p>

	<p>“Such a diverse range of talent, minds and ideas in one area, I think, is amazing and really speaks to the breadth and depth of John Molson and its international case competition,” he said.</p>

	<p>But there’s more to it than that, he added.</p>

	<p>“Beyond the ideas, beyond the competition, it’s just a lot of fun,” he continued.</p>

	<p>“It’s been a ride—the nerves, the competition, everything—there’s a lot of great things happening here.”</p>

			<p>Despite originally planning to reopen in January, Concordia’s campus bar will remain closed indefinitely.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Construction has yet to begin inside Reggie’s, Concordia’s student-run bar in the Hall Building mezzanine, while the university and the Concordia Student Union continue to discuss what infrastructure inside the space needs fixing, according to a report to <span class="caps">CSU</span> council by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp, the CSU’s for-profit arm.</p>

	<p>Following the bar’s closure in October, the renovation project managers were told by two separate contracting companies of maintenance and infrastructure problems, according to the report, with <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp chairperson James Tyler Vaccaro later elaborating the issues were mostly plumbing-related. </p>

	<p>“According to the current lease agreement these aspects fall under the legal obligation of the university to ensure the upkeep and repair,” stated the press release, released before the CSU’s regular council meeting last week. “In light of this clause, the [CUSAcorp Board of Directors] decided to approach the university to discuss our concerns with the state of the Reggie’s space, and to begin the process of working together on this project going forward.”</p>

	<p><span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp began discussions with the university at a meeting Dec. 6, where the Board presented to Concordia administrators their plans for the bar and surrounding space leased by the university to the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and managed by <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp.</p>

	<p>Concordia’s Facilities Management was tasked with providing their own assessment of the infrastructure repairs needed, which only included a minor issue of pipes being wrapped in insulation.</p>

	<p>“From what we have been told by the contractors and project managers, as well as after having reviewed the space, in our estimation this is nowhere near the full extent of the space’s current issues,” the report continued.</p>

	<p>Vaccaro, also the <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Clubs and Internal Affairs, added in an interview with The Link that a third party at the behest of <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp will offer an independent evaluation to both the Board and the university.</p>

	<p>Vaccaro says the university welcomed the independent party performing its own inspection of the bar’s infrastructure. An agent of Facilities Management was unable to be reached for comment by press time.</p>

	<p>“If we all come to the table I think we can work together to create something great,” said Vaccaro.</p>

	<p>“I get the question everyday of when is Reggie’s reopening; I’ve been getting it since before we even closed it. If there’s anyone who would rather have Reggie’s open and up and running today, [that person] would be me,” he continued. </p>

	<p>That being said, Vaccaro adds the <span class="caps">CSU</span> wants to “make sure we’re doing it right,” even if that means Reggie’s won’t reopen anytime soon.    </p>

	<p>“We don’t want to rush through because if you’re rushing through the process just to get something open again, [it would be] doing a disservice to students in the long run,” he said.  </p>

	<p>Vaccaro, also the <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Clubs and Internal Affairs, added in an interview with The Link that a third party at the behest of <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp will offer an independent evaluation to both the Board and the university.</p>

	<p>Vaccaro says the university welcomed the independent party performing its own inspection of the bar’s infrastructure. An agent of Facilities Management was unable to be reached for comment by press time.</p>

	<p>“If we all come to the table I think we can work together to create something great,” said Vaccaro.</p>

	<p>“I get the question everyday of when is Reggie’s reopening; I’ve been getting it since before we even closed it. If there’s anyone who would rather have Reggie’s open and up and running today, [that person] would be me,” he continued. </p>

	<p>That being said, Vaccaro adds the <span class="caps">CSU</span> wants to “make sure we’re doing it right,” even if that means Reggie’s won’t reopen anytime soon.    </p>

	<p>“We don’t want to rush through because if you’re rushing through the process just to get something open again, [it would be] doing a disservice to students in the long run,” he said.  </p>

			<p>One of Quebec’s largest and more militant student federations is reaching out to anglophones by publishing an English-language edition of its quarterly newspaper for the first time since fall 2010.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante is releasing the English-language version of its newspaper, Ultimatum, in the next two weeks, said co-spokesperson Benjamin Gingras.</p>

	<p>“There is a massive number of anglophone students who are as affected by questions of austerity, tuition fees and basically the whole student condition. The idea is to be inclusive and reach out to all students regardless of language,” he said. </p>

	<p>“These are issues that go beyond the language barrier.”</p>

	<p>With a circulation of 2,000 copies, the English-language edition of Ultimatum will be distributed at Concordia and McGill University, as well as Dawson College and Marianopolis College, two English <span class="caps">CEGEP</span>s in Montreal. </p>

	<p>ASSÉ represents about 70,000 students in 40 universities and <span class="caps">CEGEP</span> student associations across the province. However, only two of these associations are anglophone, Concordia’s School of Community and Public Affairs Student Association and McGill’s Art History and Communication Studies Graduate Students Association.</p>

	<p>Gingras says there is a lack of English student associations because of cultural differences. </p>

	<p>“ASSÉ has been part of a union-inspired movement. Unionism isn’t a concept that’s as developed in the U.S. or English Canada,” he said. </p>

	<p>Being part of the small anglophone minority in ASSÉ has its benefits, says <span class="caps">SCPASA</span> executive secretary Lucinda Marshall-Kiparissis. </p>

	<p>“It’s given us some visibility with other student groups,” she said. “It’s actually positive to show that there are progressive anglophone student voices that can interact and bridge those individual cleavages between language divisions in the province.” </p>

	<p>She added that membership has also given the <span class="caps">SCPASA</span> the opportunity to help shape provincial policy on student issues. The association voted in favour of joining ASSÉ in March 2013.</p>

	<p>Concordia’s Fine Arts Student Alliance is thinking about following suit. The question of membership will be put to fine arts students in a vote this spring. Already, there are “buds of enthusiasm” for joining ASSÉ, said <span class="caps">FASA</span> general coordinator Aditi Ohri, “but it’s going slowly,” she continued. “We don’t think we’ll make a decision until the referendum this March.”</p>

	<p>The decision to publish ASSÉ’s newspaper in English is a positive step toward “connecting with other anglophone schools,” she said, adding that the English version of ASSÉ’s website isn’t up to par with the French one.</p>

	<p>Founded in 2001, the same year as ASSÉ, Ultimatum is intended to present an alternative to the mainstream media. ASSÉ hasn’t published the newspaper in English since the student strike in 2012, when it printed a two-page “express” edition. </p>

	<p>“It has a perspective that’s not often heard in a lot of anglophone student political spaces,” said Marshall-Kiparissis. “To add that other voice can only be valuable.”</p>

			<p><i>Motion Binding Union&#8217;s For-Profit Arm to Seek Only Co-Op Tenants Passes </i></p>

			<p>In an attempt to move forward from a seemingly cyclonic disagreement, the Concordia Student Union has officially obligated its for-profit arm to discontinue leasing the Hall Building mezzanine space to tenant Java U once the current lease expires.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> had already been mandated by students to “establish or help found” a student-run café or restaurant in the space with a referendum question passed in the November byelections, which received about 80 per cent support.</p>

	<p>But despite the <span class="caps">CSU</span> Judicial Board decision to respect the referendum results, multiple concerns continued into the new year among council members and members of CUSAcorp’s Board of Directors over the implementation of the referendum results and even the wording of the question—which some members of council argued was biased towards only two answers: a not-for-profit organization run by students in the space, or a for-profit corporation similar to its current tenant.</p>

	<p>“The <span class="caps">CSU</span> becomes crippled by infighting all too often,” said <span class="caps">CSU</span> President Melissa Kate Wheeler. “I am certain that this has been a large contributor to some of our most exciting, beneficial projects taking years to inch forward in their progress.”</p>

	<p>“We took time to discuss our differences of opinion, and are now prepared to take the next step,” she continued. “It is not in the best interest of students to continue to fight over these differences.”</p>

	<p>Differences first arose between certain <span class="caps">CSU</span> executives and councillors even before the Java U space question first appeared on the byelection ballot. <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp chairperson James Tyler Vaccaro—also <span class="caps">CSU</span> VP Clubs and Internal—told <em>The Link</em> in October that <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp would not seek to push out Java U from the space they currently still lease and would instead explore multiple new tenant options for long-term financial sustainability.</p>

	<p>Under the motion approved by council on Jan. 8, <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp Board members will continue to explore the space’s financial sustainability, but only under student-run co-operative business models.</p>

	<p>However, the motion won’t change much, according to Vaccaro.</p>

	<p>“The motion that revolved around not renewing the Java U lease was not really a surprise to <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp,” said Vaccaro. “It pretty much would be expected from the plans [we had] we were going to be doing that anyway.” </p>

	<p>The motion passed by council also stated <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp would investigate the space’s future from a financial standpoint while an internal ad-hoc committee formed by the <span class="caps">CSU</span> in November continues to determine the best co-op management structure and services that could be offered in the space.</p>

	<p>This prompted some criticism from councillors, notably engineering and computer science representative Chuck Wilson. </p>

	<p>Wilson told the rest of council on Jan. 8 that having a second group look into the space could potentially prove more costly or be redundant. </p>

	<p>“They may indeed overlap, but this should not be a concern,” Wheeler told <em>The Link</em>. </p>

	<p>“The motion was amended to include a clause ensuring that both bodies communicate and work together towards a common goal,” she continued, adding that because <span class="caps">CUSA</span>corp has to present its findings during the regular council meeting in February, any overlap can be dealt with.</p>

	<p>Focusing each group on different facets of establishing a co-op in the mezzanine space could also prove more effective, according to Vaccaro.</p>

	<p>“I think it will allow everyone to focus on different parts of the project they feel are most important, and at the end of the day we’re all working towards the same goal,” he said.</p>

	<p>And according to Jessica Cabana—a member of the <span class="caps">CSU</span> ad-hoc committee dealing with the Java U space who helped launch the referendum campaign in favour of removing the coffee shop from the mezzanine—the CSU’s motion is also symbolic of getting back on track. </p>

	<p>“I think it’s a step towards what students voted for, which is in and of itself moving away from the debate around the referendum question,” she said.</p>

			<p>In a move not so surprising given the project’s history, the Concordia Student Union has announced that—once again—The Hive Café will not be opening on schedule. It’s an announcement that students have been hearing for nearly half a decade.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Multiple years of <span class="caps">CSU</span> executive teams have promised to have the fabled Loyola café up and running, and for multiple years that promise has failed to materialize into the student-run and operated hub that students were told they’d receive.</p>

	<p>While having the Hive as their legacy would be impressive, given everything else the <span class="caps">CSU</span> has on its plate, it simply doesn’t seem realistic nor wise to strive for yet another massive undertaking. The project has proved to be a more formidable foe than anticipated, and it’s time the executive shifts their focus instead on what can be delivered to students before their mandate is over. </p>

	<p>A smaller scale project that would see the Hive as a place for students to grab a cup of coffee and a muffin before class is admittedly less impressive than a café that boasts the food of multiple countries, but it’s also a whole lot more realistic. </p>

	<p>This was the plan when the current <span class="caps">CSU</span> executive took office, but it wasn’t an end-game—it was their hopeful starting point for the Hive to grow from last September, which also didn’t happen.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> ought to focus on what they can accomplish before their time is up. Already their plate seems full, dealing with the disaster that is Reggie’s and the divide among council on what to do with the Java U space. Starting small is not the end of the world, and right now it’s the best thing the union can do. </p>

	<p>A Hive café that was primarily a place to buy pre-wrapped sandwiches and coffee would be a considerably smaller project to get off the ground, and would double as a way to gauge interest in such a thing at Loyola. </p>

	<p>The Loyola Luncheon and the free vegetarian meals it serves up has yet to see the same popularity that the downtown equivalent, the People’s Potato, does, and it’s hard to believe that people will be interested in paying for full meals in the Hive space if it’s hard to attract a crowd for free food. </p>

	<p>If students express interest in a smaller endeavour, then future <span class="caps">CSU</span> executives can tackle the issue of expansion. Building a dream café in the span of a year has proved impossible time and time again, and there’s nothing to show that this executive will be able to beat the odds before we’re busy electing a new one.</p>

	<p>Every year, we start over from nothing. Look at the electrical issues plaguing the Hive space—issues that current VP Loyola Crystal Harrison was told had been resolved years ago while in fact they weren’t.</p>

	<p>If history has taught us anything about student union executives at Concordia, it’s that often there are great lapses in time between strong executives, and it would be a shame to see something that requires intensive maintenance and construction from the get-go flail after a year because the infrastructure needed to maintain it is weak. </p>

	<p>If and when The Hive Café opens, it could very well be a successful source of food for students looking to break with what mega-corporation Chartwells has to offer at the cafeteria, but so far the <span class="caps">CSU</span> has done little to show they are capable to be in charge of such an undertaking. If this executive can succeed in one or two services in the space, then next year we can build on that.</p>

	<p>If not, then the cycle of big plans and disappointment continues.</p>

			<p>In a move not so surprising given the project’s history, the Concordia Student Union has announced that—once again—The Hive Café will not be opening on schedule. It’s an announcement that students have been hearing for nearly half a decade.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Multiple years of <span class="caps">CSU</span> executive teams have promised to have the fabled Loyola café up and running, and for multiple years that promise has failed to materialize into the student-run and operated hub that students were told they’d receive.</p>

	<p>While having the Hive as their legacy would be impressive, given everything else the <span class="caps">CSU</span> has on its plate, it simply doesn’t seem realistic nor wise to strive for yet another massive undertaking. The project has proved to be a more formidable foe than anticipated, and it’s time the executive shifts their focus instead on what can be delivered to students before their mandate is over. </p>

	<p>A smaller scale project that would see the Hive as a place for students to grab a cup of coffee and a muffin before class is admittedly less impressive than a café that boasts the food of multiple countries, but it’s also a whole lot more realistic. </p>

	<p>This was the plan when the current <span class="caps">CSU</span> executive took office, but it wasn’t an end-game—it was their hopeful starting point for the Hive to grow from last September, which also didn’t happen.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> ought to focus on what they can accomplish before their time is up. Already their plate seems full, dealing with the disaster that is Reggie’s and the divide among council on what to do with the Java U space. Starting small is not the end of the world, and right now it’s the best thing the union can do. </p>

	<p>A Hive café that was primarily a place to buy pre-wrapped sandwiches and coffee would be a considerably smaller project to get off the ground, and would double as a way to gauge interest in such a thing at Loyola. </p>

	<p>The Loyola Luncheon and the free vegetarian meals it serves up has yet to see the same popularity that the downtown equivalent, the People’s Potato, does, and it’s hard to believe that people will be interested in paying for full meals in the Hive space if it’s hard to attract a crowd for free food. </p>

	<p>If students express interest in a smaller endeavour, then future <span class="caps">CSU</span> executives can tackle the issue of expansion. Building a dream café in the span of a year has proved impossible time and time again, and there’s nothing to show that this executive will be able to beat the odds before we’re busy electing a new one.</p>

	<p>Every year, we start over from nothing. Look at the electrical issues plaguing the Hive space—issues that current VP Loyola Crystal Harrison was told had been resolved years ago while in fact they weren’t.</p>

	<p>If history has taught us anything about student union executives at Concordia, it’s that often there are great lapses in time between strong executives, and it would be a shame to see something that requires intensive maintenance and construction from the get-go flail after a year because the infrastructure needed to maintain it is weak. </p>

	<p>If and when The Hive Café opens, it could very well be a successful source of food for students looking to break with what mega-corporation Chartwells has to offer at the cafeteria, but so far the <span class="caps">CSU</span> has done little to show they are capable to be in charge of such an undertaking. If this executive can succeed in one or two services in the space, then next year we can build on that.</p>

	<p>If not, then the cycle of big plans and disappointment continues.</p>

			<p>As technology progresses, one might be tempted to wave goodbye to such age-old art forms as drawing or silk screening and label them outdated. But for one arts centre, a different idea emerged: why not just bring them into the 21st century? </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>On Jan. 16, Montreal art gallery Eastern Bloc will be doing exactly that in its latest exhibit <em>TrailMix</em>. Its featured works combine some of art’s oldest mediums with modern technology, often surprising showgoers.</p>

	<p>“The audience reception, or the audience’s awareness of digital art is quite lacking,” said gallery co-founder Eliane Ellbogen. “There’s a lot of work that needs to be done in terms of educating larger audiences about how digital media and art are so closely linked and how these artistic practices are part of the larger contemporary art context.&#8221;</p>

	<p>“Some people don’t even see digital art as being part of the contemporary art world, whether it’s commercial or non-commercial.”</p>

	<p>But, as technology and art progress together, it seems perhaps people are going to have to start doing so.</p>

	<p>“You have a lot of artists working on the Internet, incorporating networks into their art practice. Within the art world it’s hard to ignore contemporary net artists or any artist incorporating digital media because the disseminating of their work reaches a much larger audience,” Ellbogen said.</p>

	<p>“It’s been a fact now for at least a decade. I think that for a larger audience to come to terms with that within the art world, there needs to be more and more exposure to those practices incorporating visual media.”</p>

	<p><strong>Something Old, Something New</strong></p>

	<p>Inaugurated in 2007 and operating out of the Mile End, Eastern Bloc is a niche artist-run exhibition and production centre with a specialization in digital and electronic arts, and audio and visual installations.</p>

	<p>But despite its focus on new media, Eastern Bloc doesn’t see more traditional media, like drawing, as obsolete. The <em>TrailMix</em> exhibit is all about honouring the past by incorporating it into the future.</p>

	<p>“What we were trying to achieve with the exhibit was to take more traditional practices, like drawing or silk screening, and to reinterpret them in a digital context,” Ellbogen said.</p>

	<p>“In some cases it meant using the screen, in some cases it meant referring to a screen, in other cases it meant using the gallery as the screen—using the existing space as the visual basis for the work,” she explained.</p>

	<p>“It’s an interesting intersection, especially in regards to <em>TrailMix</em>, between concept, technique, traditional practices and contemporary, technology-based practices.”</p>

	<p>Concordia professor Alice Jarry, who produced the exhibit’s “_v2Récurrences” illustration with Montreal-based engineer Christian Pelletier, feels that traditional media are expanding past our original conceptions of them.</p>

	<p>“For me, drawing is more about how you can leave a trace in space on the surface,” she said. “It’s more about the question of movement, trace and space all together. It can be so many things […]. To me, drawing can be a part of anything.”</p>

	<p>As an artist who used to work primarily in printmaking and has now moved into newer media, Jarry constantly engages with the differences between digital and physical spaces. Her piece is an interactive experience, producing kinetic animations onto the installation based on the spectator’s movements.</p>

	<p>“I think it’s a different type of architecture. I think your body reacts to it differently, but in the end they’re both physical,” Jarry said.</p>

	<p>The piece combines her practice of screenprinting with the concept of the body’s relationship to different spaces.</p>

	<p>“Screenprinting is a very mechanical medium and all the tools and apparatuses of printmaking make it very normalizing and mechanical,” she said. “It’s made in a way that pieces are supposed to look alike. But I’m never feeling the same when I print.</p>

	<p>“My body gets tired, the pressure of my hands is different, the position of my body in space is different,” she continued. </p>

	<p>“So [I wondered] how can I explore that whole idea of transient movement—movements of the body that are different—to create different kinds of images depending on how I react with the materials?”</p>

	<p><strong>Every Step You Take</strong></p>

	<p>While in Jarry’s interactive piece the implementation of technology is very apparent, for other artists it was used more behind the scenes.</p>

	<p>In her piece “Transaction Trails,” Ontario native Andrea Campbell hopes to explore the place of technology in our daily lives, especially in those places we might not commonly think about.</p>

	<p>“I started to become interested in surveillance practices, especially what was happening with the contemporary police archives, and this idea of surveillance assemblage,” she said.</p>

	<p>“It’s all about tracing a person’s movement and habits, so through that I wanted to find a way to illustrate data and surveillance practices that are usually invisible.”</p>

	<p>Campbell explained that when police track a person, they are not experiencing the actual person, but instead the representation of that person exposed through the technology used.</p>

	<p>“I became really interested in seeing what kind of portrait it would create if I started making these artworks that were pieces of artifacts about a larger picture, a body viewed solely through data,” Campbell said.</p>

	<p>In her work, Campbell tracked her daily movements through the receipts she acquired throughout the day, mapping them and creating a single image of various journeys.</p>

	<p>“I like to think of it as an alternative way of viewing a body,” she said. “I want to show it as an extension of self but also as this idea of another way in contemporary society to view the body.”</p>

	<p><strong>Reinterpreting the Digital</strong></p>

	<p>Like many of the exhibits at Eastern Bloc, <em>TrailMix</em> is meant to stretch the minds of exhibit visitors and their conceptions of art.</p>

	<p>“It will challenge audiences’ expectations of typical digital art. We’re really reinterpreting the idea of the screen and reinterpreting the role of drawing in contemporary art practices,” Ellbogen said.</p>

	<p>“An audience familiar with contemporary art might feel challenged because they won’t necessarily agree with what we’re putting forward. On a conceptual or aesthetic level, the work itself is challenging in the sense that it’s dynamic, it will engage the senses and get [the audience] thinking about what they’re looking at.” </p>

			<p><i>New Montreal Theatre Company Debuts Edward Albee Mash-up Production</i></p>

			<p>What do you get when you cross an ordinary park bench, a disappearing circumcision and a diabolical murder scheme? Montreal’s new Chocolate Moose Theatre Company is connecting these dots with the debut production of Edward Albee’s <em>At Home at the Zoo</em> at Theatre Sainte Catherine.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Four friends and recent university grads Emily Murphy, Rowan Spencer, Andrew Cameron and Martin Law created the Chocolate Moose Theatre Company this past September as a means to satisfy their theatre cravings while creating accessible and affordable theatre in Montreal.</p>

	<p>The McGill and Concordia alumni worked together throughout university in shows by the McGill Players and Tuesday Night Café. After graduation they tried seeking other theatre outlets in Montreal outside of the McGill community, but weren’t quite satisfied, and realized that in order to get back onstage they had to take things into their own hands.</p>

	<p>Law had <em>At Home at the Zoo</em> on the list of plays he hoped to direct and approached his three friends, all itching for an opportunity to perform, for help. And thus, Chocolate Moose Theatre Company was born.</p>

	<p>For the four lovers of the stage, there was a steep learning curve in launching their own company.</p>

	<p>“It’s challenging, figuring out where to begin,” said Murphy.</p>

	<p>“When you’re cast in a play, the venue, the designing, the publicist—that’s already done for you. Now we have to figure it out on our own.”</p>

	<p>But the flipside is being able to exercise complete creative control. For Cameron, managing his own theatre production has been “ultimately more satisfying” than simply participating in one.</p>

	<p>The company is already making use of that newfound creative control with <em>At Home at the Zoo</em>, a politically subversive production that combines the 1958 classic <em>The Zoo Story</em> with its prequel, <em>Homelife</em>, composed in 2004. Iconic American playwright Edward Albee wrote both.</p>

	<p>The play begins by following Peter, a successful book publisher in New York City, played by Spencer. Peter has it all—a house, a loving wife, two daughters, two parakeets and a cat.</p>

	<p>“Peter treats his life like we treat public transit: read a book, block out the noise and avoid eye contact,” said Law.</p>

	<p>But everything changes when one night Peter is confronted by his wife Ann, played by Murphy, who tells him that ordinary isn’t enough for her anymore, and challenges the notion that happiness is only found in the warm confines of safety and predictability.</p>

	<p>The second half of the play opens with Peter reading on a park bench in Central Park, where he’s confronted by Jerry, an absurd and lonely stranger played by Cameron. Through Jerry’s stories, observations, sensitivity and enthusiasm, Peter learns a lesson about the wonderful things that can happen outside one’s comfort zone.</p>

	<p>Albee initially wrote the second act as a one-act play, <em>Peter and Jerry</em>, more commonly known as <em>The Zoo Story</em>. Nearly 50 years later, he decided to revisit his critically acclaimed work and create a background story for Peter, a prequel to the first classic, calling it <em>Homelife</em>. Chocolate Moose decided to combine the two, creating a full-length play that’s full of heart.</p>

	<p>“We chose this play because everyone can relate to it,” said Murphy. “It deals with [the] real human condition through real human conversation.”</p>

	<p>Though parts of the play were written nearly half a century ago, Law says the themes of alienation, social class structures and human communication remain just as relevant today. </p>

	<p>“Deep down, we’re terrified and conditioned against the kind of intimacy, trust and vulnerability required to genuinely understand or reach others, and the society we live in is built over that broken glass,” said Law.</p>

	<p>The Chocolate Moose founders plan to address the flaws of that metaphorical broken glass head-on in the production.</p>

	<p>“It’s an important play—it demonstrates life’s true priorities by contrasting someone who has everything, yet feels nothing, with someone who has nothing yet feels everything,” said Cameron.</p>

	<p>The company can relate to the earnest character of Jerry when it’s onstage—passionate and appreciative. When post-graduation life deprived them of pursuing their dreams, they quenched their thirst for performance by creating their own independent company.</p>

	<p>After many late-night rehearsals in friends’ living rooms, carrying a park bench around the city in minus 20-degree weather and learning how to discuss circumcision for a long amount of time without laughing, the first Chocolate Moose production is underway. You’d be surprised what could happen on a park bench.</p>

	<p><em>At Home at the Zoo</em> // Jan. 16 to Jan. 18 // Theatre Sainte Catherine (264 Ste. Catherine St. E.) // 8 p.m. // $14 + fees</p>

	<p>“Peter treats his life like we treat public transit: read a book, block out the noise and avoid eye contact,” said Law.</p>

	<p>But everything changes when one night Peter is confronted by his wife Ann, played by Murphy, who tells him that ordinary isn’t enough for her anymore, and challenges the notion that happiness is only found in the warm confines of safety and predictability.</p>

	<p>The second half of the play opens with Peter reading on a park bench in Central Park, where he’s confronted by Jerry, an absurd and lonely stranger played by Cameron. Through Jerry’s stories, observations, sensitivity and enthusiasm, Peter learns a lesson about the wonderful things that can happen outside one’s comfort zone.</p>

	<p>Albee initially wrote the second act as a one-act play, <em>Peter and Jerry</em>, more commonly known as <em>The Zoo Story</em>. Nearly 50 years later, he decided to revisit his critically acclaimed work and create a background story for Peter, a prequel to the first classic, calling it <em>Homelife</em>. Chocolate Moose decided to combine the two, creating a full-length play that’s full of heart.</p>

	<p>“We chose this play because everyone can relate to it,” said Murphy. “It deals with [the] real human condition through real human conversation.”</p>

	<p>Though parts of the play were written nearly half a century ago, Law says the themes of alienation, social class structures and human communication remain just as relevant today. </p>

	<p>“Deep down, we’re terrified and conditioned against the kind of intimacy, trust and vulnerability required to genuinely understand or reach others, and the society we live in is built over that broken glass,” said Law.</p>

	<p>The Chocolate Moose founders plan to address the flaws of that metaphorical broken glass head-on in the production.</p>

	<p>“It’s an important play—it demonstrates life’s true priorities by contrasting someone who has everything, yet feels nothing, with someone who has nothing yet feels everything,” said Cameron.</p>

	<p>The company can relate to the earnest character of Jerry when it’s onstage—passionate and appreciative. When post-graduation life deprived them of pursuing their dreams, they quenched their thirst for performance by creating their own independent company.</p>

	<p>After many late-night rehearsals in friends’ living rooms, carrying a park bench around the city in minus 20-degree weather and learning how to discuss circumcision for a long amount of time without laughing, the first Chocolate Moose production is underway. You’d be surprised what could happen on a park bench.</p>

			<p><i>The Latest from Crusades Pushes the Limits of Punk</i></p>

			<p>The high-brow melodic punk of Crusades takes on an almost black metal atmosphere on their latest record.  </p>
			
			
			<p>The biggest difference between a black metal record and the latest from anthemic anti-Christian punk band Crusades is that only one compels you to sing along.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p><em>Perhaps You Deliver This Judgment With Greater Fear Than I Receive it</em>, released last November, is a rallying cry for secular thought and a damnation of Catholic oligarchy—with its lyrics tracing back to the 16th century.</p>

	<p>The record revolves around the writing of philosopher Giordano Bruno, who was executed in 1600 for refusing to denounce his theory that the Sun was just another star in an infinite universe. Every song title is a loose translation of Bruno’s Latin texts, and the record’s name was Bruno’s response to his death sentence.</p>

	<p>“Bruno’s story actually came to me as a result of a lengthy obsession with Roman Polanski’s film <em>The Ninth Gate</em> and Arturo Pérez-Reverte’s novel <em>The Club Dumas</em>,” says Dave Williams, guitarist and singer of the Ottawa-based four-piece.</p>

	<p><em>The Ninth Gate</em>, based on Pérez-Reverte’s novel, centres around a fictional book by Aristide Torchia derived from a text by Satan himself. Torchia’s character is thought to be based on Bruno.</p>

	<p>It’s the philosopher’s solemn, hooded face on the cover of <em>Perhaps You Deliver&#8230;</em>, an image taken from his dark, imposing statue in Rome’s Campo de’ Fiori, where he was burned at the stake for heresy.</p>

	<p>The atmosphere set by the record is the heaviest thing about it—a combination of the record’s theme, its cold, raw production and Williams’ almost academic approach to composition.</p>

	<p>“I’m only really interested in writing single, cohesive pieces, both lyrically and musically,” says Williams, who has a degree in musicology from Carleton University.</p>

	<p>“Creating a mood, an atmosphere, it needs room to ebb and flow, to breathe. Until we start writing 20-minute-plus songs, it’ll continue to take a full record to make that happen the way we want it to.”</p>

	<p>The record is almost deceptively heavy; it’s easy to get caught in the vocal melody before realizing the underlying intensity—furious, metal leads and crushing, shape-shifting rhythm.</p>

	<p>As they hone their sound, it continues to move beyond the more straightforward melodic punk heard on their first LP, 2011’s <em>The Sun is Down and the Night is Riding in</em>, be it the hymn-like vocal phrasing of “The Transport of Intrepid Souls” or the ‘80s metal shining through the second half of “The Art of Memory.”</p>

	<p>It’s a product of the band branching out of their collective comfort zone.</p>

	<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 142px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2836238256/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/t=8/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe></p>

	<p>“As we’ve grown closer as musicians and friends, we’ve gotten more comfortable with bringing our individual influences to the table and working to incorporate them into our sound,” says Williams, which for him meant pulling more from hardcore and metal.</p>

	<p>The album was recorded, mixed and mastered in Ottawa by Mike Bond, who also worked the board for 2012’s <em>Parables</em> EP. There’s nothing pretty about Bond’s production style. It sounds the way punk should—dirty, booming and huge—while crafting an array of metal guitar tones.</p>

	<p>“We grew up playing music with Mike, and as such, we share many sonic touchstones that I’ve asked him to strive for,” says Williams. “Whether it’s Cave In-esque tones or Barrit-style cleans, Mike knows exactly what I mean and that goes a long way toward achieving a specific vision.”</p>

	<p>Crusades is a band all about composition. They have wives, “real” jobs and Williams is a father, but they’re already planning to work on their follow-up LP this summer, and aim to go on an East Coast U.S. tour in the fall.</p>

	<p>They’re also now backed by Gainesville-based No Idea Records—a dream come true for Williams.</p>

	<p>“No Idea has been my favourite label for many, many years, and to now call it home is surreal, humbling and crazy,” he says.</p>

	<p>The feeling is mutual. No Idea signed Crusades after the label’s publicist, Tony Weinbender, was blown away by their set at The Fest, the annual punk festival in Florida he organizes.</p>

	<p>And while this record is an immediately engaging performance of furious punk rock, the intent is far beyond just that.</p>

	<p>“The hope is that, by combining an intense atmosphere, a passionate message and memorable songwriting, what’s being shouted back at us will have more behind it than just volume and melody,” says Williams. “It’ll have something that people can connect to, with lyrical and musical complexities that reveal themselves a little more with each listen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;‘Whoas’ and ‘heys’ have their time and place—but doesn’t everyone prefer to sweatily scream something that just might give them chills as well?”</p>

			<p>The cover of Lucy Soutter&#8217;s latest book &#8220;Why Art Photography?&#8221; </p>
			
			
			<p>It’s likely you’ve heard this cynical idiom that exists within the art world and other disciplines: “those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” It might apply to your fresh-faced economics professor, but it certainly doesn’t apply to British artist Lucy Soutter. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Guest speaker for the upcoming Speaking of Photography lecture at Concordia, Soutter is an artist, art historian, critic and university lecturer with a BA from Harvard and a PhD from Yale who has been an important player in the expansive world of contemporary art for decades.</p>

	<p>“I started out as a photographer,” she said. “Later I trained in art history specifically because I wanted to teach in art schools, which I now do, and I also work as a critic. So I’m pretty deeply invested in photography on a number of different levels.”</p>

	<p>Her latest book, <em>Why Art Photography?</em>, opens a dialogue on key issues currently at the heart of contemporary photography, and speculates on the future of the craft. Her book also provides a helpful introduction to art photography for students and amateur shutterbugs hoping to make it as photographers.</p>

	<p>“The book came out of teaching done in the last 15 years, and one thing I wanted to do was provide a bridge to some of the more complex, challenging theories that circulate around contemporary art,” Soutter said.</p>

	<p>The last chapter of her book, titled “Beyond Photography,” will be the basis of her talk at Concordia, taking place this Friday as a part of Speaking of Photography, an ongoing, annual series lectures organized by the Department of Art History.</p>

	<p>“[‘Beyond Photography’] summed up a lot about the increasingly important place of photography within contemporary art more broadly,” Soutter said.</p>

	<p>The lecture will focus on the expansion of photography within other interdisciplinary art practices and how it relates to other contemporary art such as painting, sculpture and video, as well as question what’s next for the medium.</p>

	<p>Soutter says contemporary photography is highly versatile, with many artists such as Walead Beshty, Rachel Harrison and Clifford Owens breaking new ground within the field.</p>

	<p>“Some of the artists I’m going to be discussing [in the lecture], who combine photography with aspects of performance, moving image, sculpture, installation, et cetera are regarded as being leading figures in contemporary art more broadly,” said Soutter.</p>

	<p>“I think it’s interesting to look at the ways that their work is grounded in photography, to explore how the ‘photographicness’ of their work might be contributing to its larger meaning.”</p>

	<p>Soutter expressed her excitement for speaking about contemporary photography at Concordia and is eager to open discussion among fine arts students.</p>

	<p>“It seemed like a good topic for a talk because I had found some exciting new artworks I wanted to talk about,” she said. </p>

	<p>“I have some fresh things to say about the area, including some thoughts I have had since finishing the book, and it’s the subject of my next research project.” </p>

			<p><i>New Local Music Company Seeks to Help Local Bands “Make It” Outside Montreal</i></p>				
			
			
			<p>It was conceived as an idea in the summer of 2013, and this past Friday it turned into a reality.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>That was when local company Coup D’Etat hosted their official launch—a music show with a variety of artists, a celebration fitting for a business that hopes to be a one stop shop for local bands. </p>

	<p>“The only thing we really care about is that Montreal bands have a better voice than they do at this time,” said Mat Barrot, one of the three founders of Coup D’Etat. “If you look at the Montreal scene, it very rarely happens that you have a bunch of kids who are actually able to make it outside of [the city].”</p>

	<p>Coup D’Etat offers everything from band and tour management to production, promotion, grant writing and more.</p>

	<p>The founders of Coup D’Etat are in it more for the music than the money—equipped with extensive experience working in the music industry, some are also musicians themselves.</p>
					
					
				
				
								<blockquote>

	<p>“We’d like to really give exposure to these bands who deserve it,” he said. “We know the talent exists, but there’s this weird hole that Quebec kind of exists here, [especially] when it comes to the punk genre.” </p>

	<p>He added that it’s not unusual for local bands in the United States to get hundreds of attendees to a show, an enthusiasm that he thinks is not currently present in Montreal’s scene. To invigorate the action and give newcomers a desired boost is the chief aim of Coup D’Etat.</p>

	<p>“That’s something we’d like to change,” he said. “That’s the reason it was started.”</p>

			<p><i>New Local Music Company Seeks to Help Local Bands “Make It” Outside Montreal</i></p>				
			
			
			<p>It was conceived as an idea in the summer of 2013, and this past Friday it turned into a reality.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>That was when local company Coup D’Etat hosted their official launch—a music show with a variety of artists, a celebration fitting for a business that hopes to be a one stop shop for local bands. </p>

	<p>“The only thing we really care about is that Montreal bands have a better voice than they do at this time,” said Mat Barrot, one of the three founders of Coup D’Etat. “If you look at the Montreal scene, it very rarely happens that you have a bunch of kids who are actually able to make it outside of [the city].”</p>

	<p>Coup D’Etat offers everything from band and tour management to production, promotion, grant writing and more.</p>

	<p>The founders of Coup D’Etat are in it more for the music than the money—equipped with extensive experience working in the music industry, some are also musicians themselves.</p>

			<p>What a difference a few months can make.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>The last time the Concordia Stingers men’s basketball team had to face the <span class="caps">UQAM</span> Citadins, on Nov. 7, they were coming off an eight-game losing streak and had mustered only one win in their 11 preseason games.  </p>

	<p>They extended their losing streak to nine after losing to <span class="caps">UQAM</span> in the 2013-2014 regular season opener that night, allowing 23 points in the fourth period in a 51-46 loss.</p>

	<p>Three months later and it’s as if a whole new Stingers team has taken the court, with the team winning its last three regular-season games and its last five match-ups overall. </p>

	<p>Two of those regular season wins came in a home-and-home sweep of the Citadins this past weekend, by the score of 67-54 and 76-68 respectively.   </p>

	<p>Stingers head coach John Dore is pleased with the turnaround, though is quick to add the team still has a ways to go. </p>

	<p>“We’re a young team, but we’re getting better and better,” said Dore at the end of his team’s first win over <span class="caps">UQAM</span>. </p>

	<p>“You can see the improvement, they can feel it. But it’s not good enough, we’ve got to keep going.” </p>

	<p>After starting the season 0-3 the Stingers currently sit in third-place in the Réseau étudiant du Québec conference with a 3-3 record.</p>

	<p>It seems all the players needed was time to get settled into their roles. </p>

	<p>“My goal is to bring energy,” said sophomore forward Michael Fosu. “Get as many rebounds and run the floor—that’s the main goal.” </p>

	<p>Players like Adam Chmielewski and Mukiya Post have been leading the way offensively, and are among the top scorers in the <span class="caps">RSEQ</span>. </p>

	<p>In Friday’s home game against <span class="caps">UQAM</span>, Post and Chmielewski scored 20 and 12 points, respectively. </p>

	<p>It may have to be a one-man show for a little while, however, as Post was seen limping around the locker room after the game with what was later confirmed as an ankle sprain. </p>

	<p>Rookie forward Josue-Smith Telfort also suffered an injury in the early part of Friday’s game. </p>

	<p>Neither he nor Post played in the follow-up match at <span class="caps">UQAM</span> the next day. </p>

	<p>The team has yet to confirm when both players will return to the lineup. </p>

	<p>In spite of these developments, the team remains hopeful it’ll be able to maintain its newfound success.  </p>

	<p>“I’m confident with this group,” Fosu said. “I’m not even hesitant about that.”</p>

	<p>“Our goal is to be better tomorrow than we were today,” added Dore. </p>

	<p>“If we do that, then we’ve got a chance in the end.” </p>

	<p>The Stingers have one more matchup versus <span class="caps">UQAM</span> this season, a home date on Feb. 13. </p>

	<p>The team’s next game is at the Laval Rouge et Or, who sit in fourth place in the RSEQ Confrerence on Jan. 16.</p>

			<p>In a game where bodies flew and landed painfully on the wooden court, the Concordia Stingers women’s basketball team could have made a case for their fifth straight win, a 67-54 trouncing of the <span class="caps">UQAM</span> Citadins on Friday, to be registered in another sport according to team head coach Keith Pruden. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>“The idea is to play basketball, not rugby,” Pruden said after the win, citing the Citadins’ physical aggressiveness. </p>

	<p>“They’re a rugby team; they don’t even try to play position defense, they just run at you and chop.” </p>

	<p>The game—the first of a home-and-home series against UQAM—saw Stingers second-year forward Marilyse Roy-Viau forced to  briefly leave the court after taking a hard hit to her nose late in the game. She finished the night with 16 points in addition to recovering eight rebounds to avenge a 53-42 loss to <span class="caps">UQAM</span> in Concordia’s season opener. </p>

	<p>“We were more prepared,” said Roy-Viau after the Friday’s game. “We knew that it was going to be really aggressive and that it was going to be a hard game.” </p>

	<p>To say it was a hard game is an understatement. There were numerous instances of collisions and hard contact between both sides, leaving players on the ground in pain. In addition to Roy-Viau taking some knocks, All-Canadian Kaylah Barrett was on the receiving end of some hard fouls. </p>

	<p>“Kaylah was getting murdered,” said Pruden. “How does an All-Canadian not get a call?”</p>

	<p>Though the team may not have gotten the calls Pruden would’ve liked, the Stingers were nonetheless able to overcome a 19-13 first-period deficit to take a 32-29 halftime lead and ultimately win the game. </p>

	<p>“We were a little rattled at the start, as we often are against them,” said Pruden. </p>

	<p>“But from the second quarter to the end, we showed a lot of composure.” </p>

	<p>The Stingers followed up Friday’s win with a 57-43 loss to <span class="caps">UQAM</span> on Saturday to fall to 3-3 on the season. They sit a game behind the second-place Citadins in the Réseau étudiant du Québec conference. </p>

	<p>But the team has improved its play overall as of late, earning a league win over Laval in November before going undefeated in its three games at the Concordia Adidas Tournament in December. </p>

	<p>“I think we’re playing better at this point this year than at this point last year, so I’m very encouraged by that,” said Pruden. </p>

	<p>Despite the team going 14-7 in all games it has played so far this season, the only ones that matter to Roy-Viau are those count towards the Stingers’ conference record. </p>

	<p>“Winning the [Concordia Adidas tournament] was nothing for us,” Roy-Viau said. “It’s all about league play, getting to the playoffs and winning in the playoffs.” </p>

	<p>The Stingers next take on the Laval Rouge et Or, fourth in the <span class="caps">RSEQ</span>, for a home-and-home series on Thursday and Saturday. Tip-off for Saturday’s game, at the Concordia gymnasium, is at 2 p.m. </p>

	<p>Though the team may not have gotten the calls Pruden would’ve liked, the Stingers were nonetheless able to overcome a 19-13 first-period deficit to take a 32-29 halftime lead and ultimately win the game. </p>

	<p>“We were a little rattled at the start, as we often are against them,” said Pruden. </p>

	<p>“But from the second quarter to the end, we showed a lot of composure.” </p>

	<p>The Stingers followed up Friday’s win with a 57-43 loss to <span class="caps">UQAM</span> on Saturday to fall to 3-3 on the season. They sit a game behind the second-place Citadins in the Réseau étudiant du Québec conference. </p>

	<p>But the team has improved its play overall as of late, earning a league win over Laval in November before going undefeated in its three games at the Concordia Adidas Tournament in December. </p>

	<p>“I think we’re playing better at this point this year than at this point last year, so I’m very encouraged by that,” said Pruden. </p>

	<p>Despite the team going 14-7 in all games it has played so far this season, the only ones that matter to Roy-Viau are those count towards the Stingers’ conference record. </p>

	<p>“Winning the [Concordia Adidas tournament] was nothing for us,” Roy-Viau said. “It’s all about league play, getting to the playoffs and winning in the playoffs.” </p>

	<p>The Stingers next take on the Laval Rouge et Or, fourth in the <span class="caps">RSEQ</span>, for a home-and-home series on Thursday and Saturday. Tip-off for Saturday’s game, at the Concordia gymnasium, is at 2 p.m. </p>

			<p><i>Get a Workout and Commute on the Cheap With Winter Biking</i></p>

			<p>In winters as cold and snow-heavy as Montreal, popular opinion would have you believe biking is a rather dangerous activity this time of year.</p>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p>Allégo Concordia says not so fast. </p>

	<p>The Concordia-based working group, whose mission is to promote cycling and public transit over driving, organized a free workshop with artist and cyclist Cam Novak on Jan. 9 to help students learn everything there is to know about winter biking—primarily, that it’s more accessible than you think.  </p>

	<p>According to Novak, the most important thing when biking in the winter is to know your limits. </p>

	<p>With proper equipment and attire, the cold weather is only an extra challenge to the workout. </p>

	<p>“I know more people who’ve gotten hurt by falling on their ass than by biking in the winter,” said Novak. </p>

	<p>Novak added that aside from being a good workout and means of transportation, cycling in any season is a way to be in control. </p>

	<p>If you want to take a break, you take a break. If you want to go fast, you pedal faster. As Novak explains, cycling is a way for him to be in control over his body and mind. </p>

	<p>“I took the metro not too long ago and as I looked around, all I could see was advertisements covering the walls and TV screens,” said Novak. “On my bike, I feel complete freedom.”</p>

	<p>In the summer like in the winter, cycling is a custom experience. It all depends on the setting, the equipment and the weather. </p>

	<p>“Do your research, and you will find what is best for you,” says Novak. </p>

	<p>Raphael Pellerin, a cyclist and employee at Montreal delivery company Courrier Rapide, explained that there are so many bicycle delivery services in the city because it’s the quickest way to get around the island. </p>

	<p>Pellerin also explained that cycling in the winter is not more dangerous than in the summer, the risks are simply different.</p>

	<p>In the winter there are more people on the sidewalks and jaywalking, in addition to more cars on the streets.</p>

	<p>In the summer people are also generally less concentrated on the roads. </p>

	<p>“I’ve had two accidents, and both happened during the summer,” said Pellerin who’s been cycling on a daily basis for over four years. </p>

	<p>Ultimately, biking in the winter may not be for everyone—but don’t knock it before you try it. You just might ditch that Opus card. </p>

	<p><b>Useful tips for winter cycling: </b><br />
•	Use a bike you don’t mind beating up<br />
•	Add knobs on your tires (especially in the front)<br />
•	Do regular maintenance on your bike<br />
•	Stick to bike-friendly neighbourhoods (Westmount, the Plateau, N.D.G., Verdun, etc.)<br />
•	Stick to the main streets because there are fewer cars in the winter <br />
•	Don’t get too close to parked cars<br />
•	Use your back brake more than your front brake<br />
•	Make turns more slowly and more upright<br />
•	Be confident on the road—you have as much right to be there as motorists <br />
•	Avoid the urge to overdress<br />
•	Wear thermal underwear <br />
•	Waterproof pants and jacket are a must <br />
•	Wear goggles and/or sun glasses<br />
•	Wear insulated and waterproof boots<br />
•	Most importantly, <span class="caps">WEAR</span> A <span class="caps">HELMET</span>! </p>

			<p><i>Stingers Set Milestones in Men’s Hockey Weekend Wins </i></p>

			<p>The Concordia Stingers men’s hockey team may not have ended 2013 the way they’d hoped, but they’ve certainly kicked off the new year in style.</p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>Coming off a tough 8-3 loss to the Ontario University Athletics top-ranked Ryerson Rams on Nov. 30 to drop to 4-8-3 on the season —barely holding onto the eighth and final playoff spot in their division—the Stingers came back strong in their first two games this weekend, beating the Laurentian Voyageurs 5-1 Friday night before defeating the Nipissing Lakers 5-2 the following afternoon.   </p>

	<p>The weekend marked the Stingers’ first consecutive wins of the season and brought their regular-season record on home ice at Ed Meagher Arena to an even 4-4. </p>

	<p>Most importantly, the two wins propelled the team into sixth place in the <span class="caps">OUA</span> East Division with a 6-8-3 record. </p>

	<p>“I think we’re working very hard as one of the youngest teams in the country,” said head coach Kevin Figsby. </p>

	<p>“When you’re in a race like we are, you’re not just trying to [ensure] your playoff berth as soon as possible; we’re trying to get ourselves up there with four of the top 10 teams in the country.” </p>

	<p>Playing a big role in Concordia’s wins was team captain George Lovatsis, who finished the weekend with two goals and five points overall. </p>

	<p>Of those goals, the one scored against Lakers goaltender Kirk Rafuse on Saturday afternoon figures to be the most memorable for Lovatsis: the goal was the 50th of his Canadian Interuniversity Sport career. </p>

	<p>“I was really happy we were able to get the wins this weekend,” said the fifth-year senior. </p>

	<p>“I guess we don’t play that many games, so 50 overall in a career is a nice milestone to hit. </p>

	<p>“I don’t think many people do it often,” he continued.</p>

 “Being in the second half of what is the end of my <span class="caps">CIS</span> career I want to do as much as I can to help the team to come out on top.”

	<p>The milestone drew Figsby’s praise. </p>

	<p>“George is the first person I’ve seen score 50 goals in my 14 years [coaching the Stingers],” said Figsby. </p>

	<p>“In four-and-a-half years with Concordia, to score 50 goals and we still have half a season to go, that’s a tremendous milestone. It just speaks volumes of his character, his person and his work ethic.” </p>

	<p>But Lovatsis’s goal wasn’t the only milestone of the weekend. </p>

	<p>Three Stingers scored their first goals in a Maroon and Gold uniform in Friday’s game: centreman Hugo Vincent, winger Anthony Nobili and newly-acquired defenceman Jeremy Barriault, whose goal came in his first-ever game as a Stinger.  </p>

	<p>Another first was for alternate captain Youssef Kabbaj, who returned to the ice this past weekend after missing most of the season to injury.   </p>

	<p>“It feels amazing, two-and-a-half months out and to come back with a great performance for all of us, was great,” said Kabbaj. </p>

	<p>“I know maybe it wasn’t my best game [Friday], but for a first game back I feel good physically; my mental game will come back more and more with each game back.”</p>

	<p>Not to be overlooked in the team’s two-game winning streak is the performance of sophomore goaltender Antonio Mastropietro, who turned aside 63 of the 66 shots he faced over the weekend. </p>

	<p>“It’s probably the best game I’ve seen us play since I’ve been at Concordia,” he said after Friday’s game. </p>

	<p>“It was really a great game. My defence really helped me see the puck, and when that happens it makes the game easier.”</p>

	<p>Five points ahead of the eighth-place Lakers in the <span class="caps">OUA</span> East standings with 11 games left, Concordia controls its own destiny to the playoffs. The team is currently 10 points behind the fifth-place Ottawa Gee-Gees.</p>

	<p>The Stingers will look to narrow that gap this Friday when they take on the Carleton Ravens at Ed Meagher Arena. Puck drops at 7:30 p.m.</p>

			<p>For the Concordia Stingers women&#8217;s hockey team, who had not played a regular season game in almost two months, it took its toll Sunday afternoon at Ed Meagher Arena—as the Bees dropped a no-contest against the visiting Université de Montréal Carabins 8-1.</p>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p>After the two previous meetings with the Carabins were both lost by 2-1 margins, this game was all in favor of the blue, black and white.</p>

	<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for the visitors to get on the scoresheet. </p>

	<p>Just under a minute into the game Katherine Richard found a loose rebound and, with Stingers rookie goaltender Briar Bache down, it easily sailed in the back of the net.</p>

	<p>The game was a statement for the Carabins, third-ranked in the Canadian Interuniversity Sports, by dominating the possession from the beginning.</p>

	<p>Midway through the first period with the Stingers trying to kill off a penalty, Carabin veteran forward Ariane Barker scored her first on the afternoon with assists from Maude Gelinas and Maude Allemoz.</p>

	<p>Barker finished the game with four goals, and Gelinas with five helpers, both aiding their team with a runaway victory.</p>

	<p>There seemed to be a couple of bright spots for Concordia following Barker&#8217;s first, when rookie Kerianne Schofield had a couple of chances on Carabin goaltender Marie-Pier Chabot. But Chabot only needed to make 11 saves to preserve the win.</p>

	<p>Barker scored another two straight to complete the natural hat trick just over a minute into the second and increased her team lead to 4-0; with all of her goals coming on the powerplay.</p>

	<p>Her team had five goals on the advantage altogether Sunday afternoon.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We definitely have to adjust things on our penalty kill,&#8221; said Stingers head coach Les Lawton. </p>

	<p>&#8220;I think we just weren&#8217;t ready; that was probably our worst game this year.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After Allemoz made it 5-0 after only 22 minutes, tempers started to get a little out of control on both sides, but especially on the Concordia bench.</p>

	<p>Carabins forward Audrey Gariepy, who originally started her <span class="caps">CIS</span> career with the Concordia Stingers in the 2011-12 season, tallied two of her own to finish the second period with a commanding 7-0 lead.</p>

	<p>Lawton finally replaced Bache to start the third, putting in Carolanne Lavoie-Pilon, who made three out of four saves in her relief effort. </p>

	<p>Barker notched her fourth and final goal of the game seven minutes into the third with Stingers defender Danielle Scarlett in the box for a body checking minor.</p>

	<p>Late in the game it appeared as if they were going to spoil Chabot&#8217;s shutout bid when defence Gabrielle Meilleur rang one off the post.</p>

	<p>They were finally able to break the goose egg in the last minute on a powerplay. </p>

	<p>A shot by rookie Alexandra D&#8217;Onofrio bounced up and then was swatted down by Audrey Morand. </p>

	<p>Although the game was all but over, the Stingers seemed content just to get on the board.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It was really a tough game out there today,&#8221; said Morand. </p>

	<p>&#8220;I think we didn&#8217;t play a 60-minute game, and we had a long week. We can&#8217;t use that as an excuse. It looked like we were all out there with crutches.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Lawton says some changes need to be made, and that the team needs to keep looking forward.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We really have to put this game behind us and get ready for Thursday,&#8221; said Lawton. </p>

	<p>&#8220;Despite our team record, our team performance has been pretty solid, and today was the first time we really faced tough adversity.&#8221;</p>

			<p>For the Concordia Stingers women&#8217;s hockey team, who had not played a regular season game in almost two months, it took its toll Sunday afternoon at Ed Meagher Arena—as the Bees dropped a no-contest against the visiting Université de Montréal Carabins 8-1.</p>
			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p>After the two previous meetings with the Carabins were both lost by 2-1 margins, this game was all in favor of the blue, black and white.</p>

	<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for the visitors to get on the scoresheet. </p>

	<p>Just under a minute into the game Katherine Richard found a loose rebound and, with Stingers rookie goaltender Briar Bache down, it easily sailed in the back of the net.</p>

	<p>The game was a statement for the Carabins, third-ranked in the Canadian Interuniversity Sports, by dominating the possession from the beginning.</p>

	<p>Midway through the first period with the Stingers trying to kill off a penalty, Carabin veteran forward Ariane Barker scored her first on the afternoon with assists from Maude Gelinas and Maude Allemoz.</p>

	<p>Barker finished the game with four goals, and Gelinas with five helpers, both aiding their team with a runaway victory.</p>

	<p>There seemed to be a couple of bright spots for Concordia following Barker&#8217;s first, when rookie Kerianne Schofield had a couple of chances on Carabin goaltender Marie-Pier Chabot. But Chabot only needed to make 11 saves to preserve the win.</p>

	<p>Barker scored another two straight to complete the natural hat trick just over a minute into the second and increased her team lead to 4-0; with all of her goals coming on the powerplay.</p>

	<p>Her team had five goals on the advantage altogether Sunday afternoon.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We definitely have to adjust things on our penalty kill,&#8221; said Stingers head coach Les Lawton. </p>

					<p>I love the outdoors as much as the next person, but this means that every time I leave my apartment I have to face my own Public Enemy No. 1: the sidewalk. Or, more specifically, the absence of salt on this skating rink you call a sidewalk.<br />
I’ve lost track of the number of times I’ve been walking down the street only to come across a single pile of salt unceremoniously dumped in the middle of the sidewalk, with no attempt made to spread it out more than a square foot. <br />
It’s as though someone emptied an entire bag of salt on a single patch of concrete, gave it a few kicks, shrugged and said, “Eh, good enough,” and carried on with their day, confident that they’d pretty much nailed it.<br />
Look guys, I get it. Times are tough, and a penny saved here and there really adds up. But you’re already (sort of) using the salt; can you at least pretend to give a damn? I’m tired of walking down the icy deathtrap of St. Denis St., shuffling like a zombie to trap as much salt under my boot as possible so I don’t slide down the street like an out-of-control bobsled racer.</p>

			<h3>A homeless man wearing a long gray T-shirt and jeans torn below the knees stands in the piercing cold as an <span class="caps">SPVM</span> officer warns him, “If I get another call about you, I’ll tie you to a pole for an hour. I swear.</h3>


			
			
			
				
				
				

				
					<p><br />

“Look at me in the eyes. I swear. I swear, I’ll tie you to a pole,” he says, wagging his finger.</p>

	<p>The man remains unresponsive. </p>

	<p>Then the person behind the camera speaks up. </p>

	<p>“Do you know that’s a threat you have no right to make, sir?”</p>

	<p>“Back up, please,” the officer says to the man filming.</p>

	<p>By now, you’ve probably seen the video captured outside Jean-Talon metro station.</p>

	<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/raMX0co42D8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

	<p>Published on YouTube on Jan. 2, it has already been viewed over 400,000 times. Not surprisingly, it’s elicited a wave of criticism, including a few tweets from on high, the Montreal mayor’s office.</p>

	<p>But many have tempered their criticism by underlining the difficulty of intervening in situations like these, often involving people with mental health issues, substance abuse problems or both. Others have gone as far as to say that dealing with homelessness shouldn’t be the police’s problem. </p>

	<p>“Police officers are not social workers, and they have other things to do than to get someone to smarten-up and dress up,” said a letter in the <em>Montreal Gazette</em> on Jan. 4 (as if getting off the street was simply a matter of “smartening up”).</p>

	<p>Homelessness and its concomitant problems are by no means the police’s responsibility alone, but if this incident proves anything, it’s that the police are still ill-equipped to deal with these issues.</p>

	<p>As a side note: homelessness and mental illness are clearly not one and the same problem, but they are closely entwined. According to a 2008 provincial study on homelessness, an estimated 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the homeless in Quebec have mental health problems and 10 per cent suffer from “severe and persistent mental illness.”</p>

	<p>The YouTube video comes at an unfortunate time for the <span class="caps">SPVM</span>. It was posted days after the police force announced the creation of a special team composed of one regular officer and a social worker to patrol neighbourhoods and help homeless people out of the cold.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">SPVM</span> received four calls about the man causing a disturbance at Jean-Talon before the incident. Where was this team when it was needed?</p>

	<p>It’s hard to say how many 911 calls involve homeless people, but, according to <span class="caps">SPVM</span> Commander Ian Lafrenière, 10,000 to 30,000 per year involve individuals with mental health issues. </p>

	<p>“It’s a situation that’s perfectly impossible to handle by ourselves. We need the help of other partners,” he said.</p>

	<p>To illustrate the trickiness of intervening in these sorts of emergencies, Lafrenière described another incident that occurred last Friday but wasn’t caught on camera. Police officers responded to a 911 call about a homeless man who had been expelled from Place-des-Arts metro station. </p>

	<p>After negotiating with him for half an hour, the police convinced him to follow them out of the station. When they stepped outside, he showed the officers that he was concealing two knives and said that he had been ready to kill himself, or draw a knife on them and commit “suicide by cop.”</p>

	<p>With regards to the recent YouTube video, Lafrenière told the <em>Gazette</em> that the officer’s actions were “unacceptable and unexplainable.” On Friday, the policeman had a meeting with his commanding officers and is facing sanctions, the details of which can’t be disclosed for legal reasons.</p>

	<p>Well, that’s a little unsatisfying. It would be nice to be sure that the <span class="caps">SPVM</span> is taking this matter seriously and following up with appropriate action, but without further information it’s impossible to know.</p>

	<p>It’s important to note that the officer in question was said to have a good record and that he had tried to bring the homeless man to a shelter, before threatening to tie him to a post in the bitter cold, like a dog on a leash.</p>

	<p>While it may very well have been an empty threat, an unfortunate slip of the tongue, it’s inexcusable coming from an officer of the law.</p>

	<p>More important than the sanctions are the precautions the <span class="caps">SPVM</span> should be taking to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen again. By all appearances, homelessness in Quebec is a growing problem. </p>

	<p>“Though initially limited to urban Montreal, homelessness has now spread to a number of Quebec’s regions,” reads the province’s report from 2008. “And those who work with the homeless have come to the unsettling conclusion that the phenomenon is growing, diversifying and becoming increasingly complex.” </p>

	<p>The same study found that resources for the homeless in Montreal, such as shelters, are becoming increasingly stretched.</p>

	<p>It’s easy to see where this is heading. As more and more people fall through the cracks, confrontations like the one recorded outside Jean-Talon will become more frequent. It’s a serious public security issue that the <span class="caps">SPVM</span> needs to be ready for. </p>

	<p>But it’s a burden that we should all share. It’s commonly said that you can judge a society by how it treats its most vulnerable. It’s about time we bring our most needy in from the cold.</p>

			<p>As students, chances are most of us have had exams with questions that require us to remember bits of information, seemingly testing little more than our ability to memorize things on demand. </p>
			
			
			
				

				
					<p>We go into the exam hoping that the questions are on the material we were able to memorize, instead of the stuff we didn’t have time to review. And once it’s over, we joke about how we’ll forget all the stuff we memorized in a week anyways. </p>

	<p>We tell ourselves that it’s a necessary part of pursuing a degree, that if we want to graduate, we’ll have to deal with it. </p>

	<p>This attitude highlights two different perspectives of students around us: for some, coming to university is about the job opportunities a degree can generate, and so the resulting diploma becomes a means to a better job or income in the future. For others, the education received is the primary goal.</p>

	<p>Far from being an insignificant difference in viewpoint, one’s own perspective on this influences the ways in which we think about not only what, but how we are taught in the classroom.</p>

	<p>Being too focused on the degree at the end of the road can keep us from being adequately critical of the instruction we receive along the way, because it places too great an emphasis on grades and leaves little room to question whether we’re getting the skills we’ll need in the post-schooling world. </p>

	<p>We should be questioning the skills we’re being taught—for the amount of time and money we put into our education, we deserve to know that we’re getting what we’re paying for. Is memorizing countless facts on demand what we’re here to learn?</p>

	<p>Memorization is of questionable importance when compared to other abilities, and arguably doesn’t deserve the emphasis that it still receives in our education. </p>

	<p>People naturally memorize and recall information as needed, like the cashier that can recall dozens of product codes without needing to take a class or be tested on it. When there’s a recurring need for a particular piece of information, it gets committed to memory.</p>

	<p>In university, it’s just as important to pay attention to what we’re taught as it is to be critical of how we’re taught and tested. A focus on the education we receive empowers us to have certain expectations and standards on the sort of learning and growth that we’ll take away from these years.</p>

	<p>If this is the case, then what kind of questions can we ask about the ways in which we are taught? How do we know we’re building useful skills?</p>

	<h4>All Teaching is Not Created Equal</h4>

	<p><br />

First, we must consider the different cognitive skills we can pick up through education.</p>

	<p>In 1956, a committee of educators, chaired by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom, produced a classification of educational objectives.</p>

	<p>Bloom’s taxonomy categorized learning skills in three separate categories: cognitive, affective and psychomotor—in other words, knowledge, attitude and skills, respectively. The majority of teaching and learning in university deals with cognitive skills, so it makes sense to focus on those for now.</p>

	<p>There are six skills in the cognitive category, arranged in a hierarchy from lowest to highest: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating and creating (or synthesizing).<br />
Remembering deals with little more than the ability to store the data relevant to one’s field of study in one’s mind and recall it at a later date. It’s the rote memorization that comprises so much of our testing and evaluation.</p>

	<p>Understanding is quite self-explanatory, and is exemplified by the ability to explain an idea or concept in one’s own words.</p>

	<p>Applying refers to using the concepts we understand and the information we can bring to mind in order to solve novel problems (an important distinction, as previously encountered problems do not necessarily require knowledge and application, and can instead be solved through memory alone).</p>

	<p>Analysis involves the ability to break down information into coherent fragments, distinguish facts from the inferences we make, and discover the relationships between these components.<br />
Evaluation is about making judgments based on a set of criteria, like when you critique the validity of or provide support for an idea, or justify a viewpoint or decision.</p>

	<p>Creating is the ability to combine information and ideas in new and previously unencountered ways, allowing for innovation and alternatives to known ways of thinking or doing things.</p>

	<p>Professors should optimally consider these six different levels of learning when they write their exam questions, and depending on how a question is formulated, it can test a student’s ability on any of the levels.</p>

	<p>Just as professors can use this tool, students can use the concepts provided by the taxonomy to judge the sort of cognitive skills emphasized by the education they are receiving (an exercise which, if you’re following along, would require the application of an understanding to evaluate something).</p>

	<p>Today, much of the information we might be required to memorize can be accessed within minutes using the potent computers most of us carry in our pockets. It’s difficult to conceive of a future situation where we’ll need to apply information we learn without being able to search through a book or the Internet for help.</p>

	<p>An education applicable to what we can expect to confront after university should therefore presumably place greater emphasis on knowing how to search for and find reliable information and piece it together intelligently, rather than on the ability to memorize.</p>

	<p>When we are tested largely on memorization and understanding, we are being taught to function as consumers of knowledge rather than learning the skills necessary to evaluate and create knowledge.</p>

	<p>The point of this article isn’t to imply that you’re getting a raw deal and you should be up in arms because you’re only being taught to memorize, because that isn’t the case.</p>

	<p>A thoughtful look at your classes should reveal that while some professors do focus more on memorization, others make the effort to engage higher-level processes so their students may come away with different ways to think and approach new information.</p>

	<p>What is important is to spend some time thinking about these differences. Think about what you take away from these different types of teaching and how that compares to what you expect from your education. It’s important not to shy away from engaging with professors and peers over your thoughts on what your classroom experience should be like.</p>

	<p>For some, this semester will mark the end of your first year, while for others it signifies the end of your degree. Wherever you are in your education, it will benefit you in the long term to be critical of how you are taught, and to assess whether that aligns with what you expect to take away from being at university. Having a set of ideas with which to evaluate the instruction we receive is a first step in doing so.</p>

<strong>No <span class="caps">CSU</span> Winter Orientation Planned for This Year</strong></p>

	<p>The Concordia Student Union will not hold a winter Orientation this year as the week of events “historically has not attracted enough students to justify its cost,” the union announced Monday.</p>

	<p>“The <span class="caps">CSU</span> Executive feels that [low attendance in the past] has not been a reflection of poor planning, but rather of the event itself,” reads a press release from the union. “It is for this reason that we have chosen not to hold a winter Orientation this year.”</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span> executive is instead promising to host a “student engagement fair” and events related to the topic of gender, as well as a party at the as-yet-unopened Hive Café. The café is meant to be a student-run alternative on the Loyola campus to Chartwells-operated cafeterias.</p>

	<p>Last year, the student union allocated $60,000 towards its winter Orientation.</p>

	<p><strong>Simone de Beauvoir Institute Reacts to Supreme Court Decision on Canada’s Prostitution Laws</strong></p>

	<p>Concordia’s Simone de Beauvoir Institute, a college devoted to studying feminism and social justice, supports the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down three Canadian laws related to prostitution.</p>

	<p>In a unanimous ruling on Dec. 20, the Supreme Court deemed prohibitions on brothels or bawdy houses, public communication for the purpose of prostitution and profiting off of prostitution to be unconstitutional.</p>

	<p>“For the Simone de Beauvoir Institute, to strike down laws which increase violence against women is an important feminist victory,” reads a statement posted to the Institute’s website. “The decision of the Supreme Court recognizes the importance of removing legal barriers to women’s safety and security.”</p>

	<p>The institute was granted intervener status by the Supreme Court, allowing it to make arguments in the case despite being a third party. In legal documents filed with the court, the institute stated it doesn’t subscribe to an “abolitionist-feminist discourse” that views prostitution as fundamentally harmful to women.</p>

	<p>The institute argued that criminalizing public solicitation could potentially endanger sex workers, as it prevents them from communicating their limits or evaluating their clients sufficiently before moving into private spaces. According to the institute, “laws which prevent clear communication between sex workers and clients prevent a frank discussion of sexuality between consenting adults.”</p>

	<p>The institute also opposed the ban on brothels and profiting from prostitution. </p>

	<p>“Sex workers cannot work together out of the same apartment, because the apartment would be considered a common bawdy house,” reads the institute’s statement. “Similarly, sex workers cannot hire a driver or a bodyguard, who would be considered to live off the avails of prostitution.”</p>

	<p>The Supreme Court gave Parliament one year to rethink the country’s prostitution laws.</p>

	<p><strong>Concordia Refutes Low Graduation Rate Cited by <em>La Presse</em></strong></p>

	<p>An article published in the Jan. 3 issue of <em>La Presse</em> has been pulled from the French-language newspaper’s website after Concordia contested some of the facts it contained.</p>

	<p>The article claimed Concordia’s graduation rate has fallen sharply in recent years. According to the article, 75 per cent of Concordia students who began their studies in 2001 had obtained their diplomas six years later, but by 2012, only 48 per cent of those students who entered Concordia six years earlier had graduated.</p>

	<p>Such a graduation rate would put Concordia far behind other Quebec universities. According to the article, the Université du Québec à Montréal, the Université de Montréal and McGill University had completion rates of 68 per cent, 78 per cent and 84 per cent, respectively, for the cohort of students entering university in 2006.</p>

	<p>But Concordia argues its graduation rate—actually 74.2 per cent for full-time undergraduates, according to the university—is favourable compared to the national average. </p>

	<p>“This faulty information about graduation rates is the result of an error in interpreting the data provided to the newspaper,” reads a statement posted on Concordia’s website.</p>

	<p>According to the university, the reporter compared 2006 graduation rates for full-time students to 2012 graduation rates for part-time students, leading to the incorrect conclusion that graduation rates had fallen drastically.</p>

	<p><strong>Student-Run Co-operative Café and New Administrative Jobs Discussed at December <span class="caps">CSU</span> Meeting</strong></p>

	<p>Councillors and executives of the Concordia Student Union were divided at the last council meeting of 2013 on the best way to create a new café on the Hall Building’s mezzanine in the location currently leased by Java U.</p>

	<p>In the CSU’s November byelections, undergraduates voted 89 per cent in favour of giving the union a mandate to “establish or help found” a student-led co-operative café or restaurant in the space, which is managed and operated by the CSU’s for-profit arm, <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp.</p>

	<p>However, <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp hopes to put out a request for proposals, a process that would see interested parties like non-profit organizations or businesses submit proposals to the <span class="caps">CSU</span> which would then be evaluated according to a predetermined set of criteria, such as whether the food will be locally sourced or the café would provide employment to students. <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp would then ask students to vote on the different proposals received.</p>

	<p>Councillors in favour of CUSACorp’s position argued that the referendum question in November unfairly presented voters with only two options—a student-led co-operative or a for-profit business like Java U. A <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp report presented by VP Clubs and Internal James Tyler Vaccaro—also the chairperson of CUSACorp—at the council meeting argued “a method which allows for the CSU’s members to vote on various food service options empowers them in the decision and provides them with the opportunity to make an informed choice.”</p>

	<p>VP Sustainability Benjamin Prunty told <em>The Link</em> that “[CUSACorp’s] recommendation was short-sighted and that adopting it would be in contravention of the Judicial Board’s reference decision.” The JB decided on Nov. 9 that the results of a referendum are binding on the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and that the <span class="caps">CSU</span> has the power under Quebec law as sole shareholders to issue directives to <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp, despite the CSU’s own bylaws stating the union will respect CUSACorp’s autonomy.</p>

	<p>“I have to be very firm in standing by the mandates that I get from students so long as they’re not injurious to other students,” <span class="caps">CSU</span> President Melissa Kate Wheeler told <em>The Link</em>.</p>

	<p>“I think that there’s something to be said for the wording of the question. I think that the question excluded other alternatives and that’s definitely an issue, but I don’t see that as enough of a problem to move away from the heart of what that question was, which I think is pretty easily discernable—that [voters] want something student-run in the Java U space.”</p>

	<p>Wheeler said she’d like to see interested individuals within the <span class="caps">CSU</span> work with <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp to “install something student-run, local, healthy and cheap into that space, whenever it becomes available.” </p>

	<p>The topic was eventually tabled until the next council meeting, which is scheduled for Jan. 8.</p>

	<p>The meeting also saw the union create three new paid positions: an events coordinator, a sustainability coordinator and a financial assistant. Wheeler said the goal is to assign some of the “non-political” administrative tasks currently performed by vice-presidents to union employees instead.</p>

	<p>“There’s enough work that is purely administrative that we could create these positions safely,” Wheeler said. </p>

	<p>“The point in all of this is to liberate, to a certain extent, the VPs to have more creativity, flexibility and whatnot in their own positions, because what we have found is that student unions with more staff get more done [and] have a higher project completion rate and a shorter time frame for those projects.”</p>

	<p>Wheeler said the positions wouldn’t be filled this academic year as the current executive has only six months left in its mandate. However, next year’s executive will have the option to fill the positions, provided that it budgets for them. </p>

	<p>“We’ve created these positions as an investment in the next executive,” said Wheeler.</p>

	<p>“Sex workers cannot work together out of the same apartment, because the apartment would be considered a common bawdy house,” reads the institute’s statement. “Similarly, sex workers cannot hire a driver or a bodyguard, who would be considered to live off the avails of prostitution.”</p>

	<p>The Supreme Court gave Parliament one year to rethink the country’s prostitution laws.</p>

	<p><strong>Concordia Refutes Low Graduation Rate Cited by <em>La Presse</em></strong></p>

	<p>An article published in the Jan. 3 issue of <em>La Presse</em> has been pulled from the French-language newspaper’s website after Concordia contested some of the facts it contained.</p>

	<p>The article claimed Concordia’s graduation rate has fallen sharply in recent years. According to the article, 75 per cent of Concordia students who began their studies in 2001 had obtained their diplomas six years later, but by 2012, only 48 per cent of those students who entered Concordia six years earlier had graduated.</p>

	<p>Such a graduation rate would put Concordia far behind other Quebec universities. According to the article, the Université du Québec à Montréal, the Université de Montréal and McGill University had completion rates of 68 per cent, 78 per cent and 84 per cent, respectively, for the cohort of students entering university in 2006.</p>

	<p>But Concordia argues its graduation rate—actually 74.2 per cent for full-time undergraduates, according to the university—is favourable compared to the national average. </p>

	<p>“This faulty information about graduation rates is the result of an error in interpreting the data provided to the newspaper,” reads a statement posted on Concordia’s website.</p>

	<p>According to the university, the reporter compared 2006 graduation rates for full-time students to 2012 graduation rates for part-time students, leading to the incorrect conclusion that graduation rates had fallen drastically.</p>

	<p><strong>Student-Run Co-operative Café and New Administrative Jobs Discussed at December <span class="caps">CSU</span> Meeting</strong></p>

	<p>Councillors and executives of the Concordia Student Union were divided at the last council meeting of 2013 on the best way to create a new café on the Hall Building’s mezzanine in the location currently leased by Java U.</p>

	<p>In the CSU’s November byelections, undergraduates voted 89 per cent in favour of giving the union a mandate to “establish or help found” a student-led co-operative café or restaurant in the space, which is managed and operated by the CSU’s for-profit arm, <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp.</p>

	<p>However, <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp hopes to put out a request for proposals, a process that would see interested parties like non-profit organizations or businesses submit proposals to the <span class="caps">CSU</span> which would then be evaluated according to a predetermined set of criteria, such as whether the food will be locally sourced or the café would provide employment to students. <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp would then ask students to vote on the different proposals received.</p>

	<p>Councillors in favour of CUSACorp’s position argued that the referendum question in November unfairly presented voters with only two options—a student-led co-operative or a for-profit business like Java U. A <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp report presented by VP Clubs and Internal James Tyler Vaccaro—also the chairperson of CUSACorp—at the council meeting argued “a method which allows for the CSU’s members to vote on various food service options empowers them in the decision and provides them with the opportunity to make an informed choice.”</p>

	<p>VP Sustainability Benjamin Prunty told <em>The Link</em> that “[CUSACorp’s] recommendation was short-sighted and that adopting it would be in contravention of the Judicial Board’s reference decision.” The JB decided on Nov. 9 that the results of a referendum are binding on the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and that the <span class="caps">CSU</span> has the power under Quebec law as sole shareholders to issue directives to <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp, despite the CSU’s own bylaws stating the union will respect CUSACorp’s autonomy.</p>

	<p>“I have to be very firm in standing by the mandates that I get from students so long as they’re not injurious to other students,” <span class="caps">CSU</span> President Melissa Kate Wheeler told <em>The Link</em>.</p>

	<p>“I think that there’s something to be said for the wording of the question. I think that the question excluded other alternatives and that’s definitely an issue, but I don’t see that as enough of a problem to move away from the heart of what that question was, which I think is pretty easily discernable—that [voters] want something student-run in the Java U space.”</p>

	<p>Wheeler said she’d like to see interested individuals within the <span class="caps">CSU</span> work with <span class="caps">CUSAC</span>orp to “install something student-run, local, healthy and cheap into that space, whenever it becomes available.” </p>

	<p>The topic was eventually tabled until the next council meeting, which is scheduled for Jan. 8.</p>

	<p>The meeting also saw the union create three new paid positions: an events coordinator, a sustainability coordinator and a financial assistant. Wheeler said the goal is to assign some of the “non-political” administrative tasks currently performed by vice-presidents to union employees instead.</p>

	<p>“There’s enough work that is purely administrative that we could create these positions safely,” Wheeler said. </p>

	<p>“The point in all of this is to liberate, to a certain extent, the VPs to have more creativity, flexibility and whatnot in their own positions, because what we have found is that student unions with more staff get more done [and] have a higher project completion rate and a shorter time frame for those projects.”</p>

	<p>Wheeler said the positions wouldn’t be filled this academic year as the current executive has only six months left in its mandate. However, next year’s executive will have the option to fill the positions, provided that it budgets for them. </p>

	<p>“We’ve created these positions as an investment in the next executive,” said Wheeler.</p>

			<p>With an ever-growing number of eyes glued to screens and a seemingly ubiquitous Internet connection, no one can deny the impact computer technology is having on our daily lives.</p>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p>But that reality doesn’t necessarily doom a child to a life of endless scrolling. </p>

	<p>Kids Code Jeunesse, a Montreal-based non-profit, is going into classrooms in two English Montreal School Board elementary schools this week, teaching students in Grades 3 to 6 the basis of computation and web design.</p>

	<p>“We want this to be within the school system, accessible to all kids free of charge, to become a tool like reading and writing is,” said Kate Arthur, the co-founder of Kids Code Jeunesse. The organization’s long-term goal is to bring coding into the curriculum of Quebec elementary schools.</p>

	<p>In the program’s pilot session last fall at the Commission scolaire de Montréal’s École au Pied-de-la-Montagne, volunteer teachers showed the students the basics of using programming as a medium. </p>

	<p>Instead of presenting their geography project on a Bristol board or with PowerPoint, they built a website to hold the information, including all the writing and research elements required in the teachers’ grading criteria. </p>

	<p>For their English class the students could create an “About Me” webpage that included the skills they needed to display to be evaluated by their teacher. </p>

	<p>“They’re learning in the school system how to turn a computer on, how to use a Word document, how to use the Internet. Kids already know how to do that,” said Arthur.</p>

	<p>“We’re trying to help with the gap in learning. They should be learning, above all, security and safety, and how it all works.” </p>

	<p><strong>More Than User-Friendly</strong></p>

	<p>When the Kids Code Jeunesse teachers at École au Pied-de-la-Montagne asked students what a computer was, most answered “Google.” Despite spending hours in front of screens every week, there’s no guarantee these children get a better understanding of how the technology really works just by using search engines and social media. </p>

	<p>The course material created by Kids Code Jeunesse provides the young students a glimpse into how much control they can have over the information displayed on a web page—a medium in which they do so much consuming.</p>

	<p>“We’re giving them the <span class="caps">ABC</span>s, and they start to create words, create sentences and write phrases,” said Arthur. “For us the younger you teach them, the more power they have to communicate in that language. It’s a tool for them to express what’s going on in their head.”</p>

	<p>For some students, it offered a whole new take on learning. Arthur recalled being approached by a mother just before the winter break, who asked if she was the one who had brought coding to the school.</p>

	<p>The mother went on to say it had changed her son’s life, that before he didn’t want to be in school but that he loved computers and technology.</p>

	<p>“She said, ‘He was failing everything, and [then] you introduced programming,’” said Arthur. “It’s what keeps him going.”</p>

	<p>Kids Code Jeunesse was started in the fall of 2012 by Arthur and Gersande La Flèche, who works as a programmer at <span class="caps">DMCS</span> Canada, a Montreal-based IT firm owned by Arthur and her husband. La Flèche, a creative writing student at Concordia, is one of the volunteer teachers who go into classes to show kids what coding can do for them.</p>

	<p>La Flèche’s interest in computers began with unblocking music websites in her school’s computer labs and storing algorithms in T-83 graphing calculators to cheat on exams at age 14.  </p>

	<p>“I didn’t realize I was doing something called computer science at the time, and that people do this for a living,” she said.</p>

	<p>Arthur and La Flèche have designed two programming courses, one for Grades 3-4 and another for Grades 5-6. The younger class learns on Scratch, a visual programming interface developed by <span class="caps">MIT</span>, and the older class works in pure HTML—the foundation of web design today.</p>

	<p>The first months of the project started with convincing school directors that coding was a skill worth learning. <span class="caps">LEARN</span> Quebec, a non-profit educational foundation that supports English education in the province, was the first to show  an interest, and La Flèche taught the two courses made available to Quebec students online.</p>

					<p>And now, after a successful semester at the École au Pied-de-la-Montagne, the eight-class courses will be taught at the Merton Elementary School in Côte St-Luc and the General Vanier Elementary School in St-Leonard. </p>

	<p>Arthur also noted that video game developer Ubisoft and simulation technologies manufacturer <span class="caps">CAE</span> have recently volunteered programmers to come into classes.</p>

	<p>Such partnerships will be important for the project going forward, as Kids Code Jeunesse is not currently receiving any government funding. Arthur has taken time off from her job at <span class="caps">DMCS</span> to work on Kids Code Jeunesse full-time until the organization can hire an administrator.</p>

	<p>Kids Code Jeunesse is currently running an Indiegogo fundraising campaign, which is just past the halfway mark of their $5,000 goal, to be raised before Jan. 19. The funds will help produce learning materials such as posters and cheat sheets, and pay for transportation for the teachers, who are student volunteers from Concordia and McGill University.</p>

	<p>This semester’s curriculum builds on what the group learned during their pilot project, and this time will include a lesson on copyright and a tutorial on safe surfing before their coding classes begin.</p>

	<p>“Teaching something like computer science is definitely a challenge for elementary kids, but at the same time it’s something they get really excited about,” said La Flèche.</p>

	<p>“It’s an interesting combination of learning a lot of very complex spelling and syntax and not make spelling errors, but it’s also like a puzzle where you’re looking for the mistake.”</p>

	<p>Beyond being a different approach to getting kids interested in math and science, Arthur said the exercises also help the students pay attention to detail—since a little error could break the entire program. Students would also debug their peers’ work. </p>

	<p>“You go to Ubisoft’s offices and it’s completely wide open, everyone’s working in teams. You have to work with programmers, designers and story editors,” said Arthur. “Computer programming is not sitting alone in your own little world and we try to break that [preconception].”</p>

	<p>La Flèche noted that programming feeds into children’s love of building things and showing what they’ve made to their friends.</p>

	<p>“At one point, one kid learned how to create iframes [frames embedding another <span class="caps">HTML</span> document] in a web page, and all of a sudden his site had his favourite Pokémon profiles, his favourite hockey player,” said La Flèche. </p>

	<p>“[And] then suddenly all the other kids are copying the iframe code from each other.” </p>

	<p>Despite the elementary school teachers often not having any background in computation, École au Pied-de-la-Montagne is still using Scratch.</p>

	<p>“One of the large hurdles at the moment is the schools not having the educators who can teach computer programming,” said Arthur. “That’s why we have university students coming in, so [the teachers] do the ‘teaching,’ and we do the programming.”</p>

	<p>This semester the organization is working to better equip the teachers to continue using code after the eight-class course is completed.</p>

	<p>“What we’re trying to do is create a talented pool of future employees,” said Arthur. “Just like how we teach people to read and write, we’re not expecting the next James Joyce—but you’re going to need to know how to read and write to get many jobs.”</p>

			<p><i>Funding Suspended to Concordia’s Defunct French-Language Magazine</i></p>				
			<img src="http://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_34/News/16ca.LOrgane_690_899_90.jpg" alt="" />

			<h3>Over two years after its last publication and despite two attempts to revive it, Concordia’s former French-language magazine <em>L’Organe</em> has had its fee levy suspended for three semesters—and it will be permanently removed unless students decide to bring the magazine back.</h3>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

<em>L’Organe</em>’s six-cent-per-credit fee levy that it has received from Concordia undergraduates since 2003 was officially suspended by the university’s Board of Governors Dec. 11, roughly 30 months after the magazine published its last issue.</p>

	<p>In April 2011, the magazine experienced a mass exodus of sorts when its masthead members largely quit or had finished their mandate and were thus unable to return the following year.</p>

	<p>Students tried twice to revive the publication, but both attempts were unsuccessful.</p>

	<p>Julien Poirier-Malo served as president of the defunct fee-levy group in 2012-2013 and spearheaded the most recent attempt to restart <em>L’Organe</em>, which he says was beset by setbacks, particularly in acquiring access to the group’s funding from students.</p>

	<p>“I took over <em>L’Organe</em> in the summer of 2012 after a year abroad. It had been on the ice for over a year already, and I decided to bring it back to life,” he said. </p>

			<p><i>Funding Suspended to Concordia’s Defunct French-Language Magazine</i></p>

			<h3>Over two years after its last publication and despite two attempts to revive it, Concordia’s former French-language magazine <em>L’Organe</em> has had its fee levy suspended for three semesters—and it will be permanently removed unless students decide to bring the magazine back.</h3>


			
			
			
				

				
					<p><br />

<em>L’Organe</em>’s six-cent-per-credit fee levy that it has received from Concordia undergraduates since 2003 was officially suspended by the university’s Board of Governors Dec. 11, roughly 30 months after the magazine published its last issue.</p>

	<p>In April 2011, the magazine experienced a mass exodus of sorts when its masthead members largely quit or had finished their mandate and were thus unable to return the following year.</p>

	<p>Students tried twice to revive the publication, but both attempts were unsuccessful.</p>

	<p>Julien Poirier-Malo served as president of the defunct fee-levy group in 2012-2013 and spearheaded the most recent attempt to restart <em>L’Organe</em>, which he says was beset by setbacks, particularly in acquiring access to the group’s funding from students.</p>

	<p>“I took over <em>L’Organe</em> in the summer of 2012 after a year abroad. It had been on the ice for over a year already, and I decided to bring it back to life,” he said. </p>

	<p>“From June to September, I recruited contributors from various fields, and we began to work on the first issue.</p>

	<p>“While all of this was going on, the bank account was still under [former general manager Gabrielle LeFort]’s name, and I didn’t have access to any money,” Poirier-Malo explained. “We had time to almost finish the issue before the administrative procedure started.” </p>
